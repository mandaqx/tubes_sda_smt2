        "abstrak":"Automated medication dispensing systems for hospital pharmacies, heralded as an important means of reducing drug errors and improving labor productivity, have also been seen as a means of furthering the transformation of the pharmacy profession from its role in dispensing prescriptions to a clinical profession concerned with treatments and patient outcomes. Automation aids this transformation by transferring the responsibility for routine dispensing to technicians performing rationalized and computer-mediated tasks. Not all pharmacists agree with these trends. Some fear a loss of professional status and employment as their knowledge is expropriated and incorporated into machinery operated by those with lesser qualifications. They fear an industrial rather than a clinical future. Their concerns are compounded by health care cutbacks. These issues were studied at two hospitals in Canada and one in France, all mid-sized public hospitals with automated unit dose drug delivery systems installed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Preliminary results indicated national differences in approaches to hospital pharmacy automation. In Canada, pharmacists have resisted major changes in their control of the dispensing process and in their traditional roles vis à vis doctors and pharmacy technicians. In France, where hospital pharmacy as a profession is less developed than in North America, automation has brought about a far more radical substitution for pharmacists' labor.",

Furthermore, MRI has the ability to characterize plaque composition and microanatomy and therefore to identify lesions vulnerable to rupture or erosion. The high resolution of MRI and the development of sophisticated contrast agents offer the promise of molecular in vivo molecular imaging of the plaque.

        "tahun_terbit":2019,
        "abstrak":"BackgroundCorneal endothelium (CE) images provide valuable clinical information regarding the health state of the cornea. Computation of the clinical morphometric parameters requires the segmentation of endothelial cell images. Current techniques to image the endothelium in vivo deliver low quality images, which makes automatic segmentation a complicated task. Here, we present two convolutional neural networks (CNN) to segment CE images: a global fully convolutional approach based on U-net, and a local sliding-window network (SW-net). We propose to use probabilistic labels instead of binary, we evaluate a preprocessing method to enhance the contrast of images, and we introduce a postprocessing method based on Fourier analysis and watershed to convert the CNN output images into the final cell segmentation. Both methods are applied to 50 images acquired with an SP-1P Topcon specular microscope. Estimates are compared against a manual delineation made by a trained observer.ResultsU-net (AUC=0.9938) yields slightly sharper, clearer images than SW-net (AUC=0.9921). After postprocessing, U-net obtains a DICE=0.981 and a MHD=0.22 (modified Hausdorff distance), whereas SW-net yields a DICE=0.978 and a MHD=0.30. U-net generates a wrong cell segmentation in only 0.48% of the cells, versus 0.92% for the SW-net. U-net achieves statistically significant better precision and accuracy than both, Topcon and SW-net, for the estimates of three clinical parameters: cell density (ECD), polymegethism (CV), and pleomorphism (HEX). The mean relative error in U-net for the parameters is 0.4% in ECD, 2.8% in CV, and 1.3% in HEX. The computation time to segment an image and estimate the parameters is barely a few seconds.ConclusionsBoth methods presented here provide a statistically significant improvement over the state of the art. U-net has reached the smallest error rate. We suggest a segmentation refinement based on our previous work to further improve the performance.",

        "abstrak":"Falsified and substandard drugs are a global health problem, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) that have weak pharmacovigilance and drug regulatory systems. Poor quality medicines have important health consequences, including the potential for treatment failure, development of antimicrobial resistance, and serious adverse drug reactions, increasing healthcare costs and undermining the public's confidence in healthcare systems. This article presents a review of the methods employed for the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations. Technologies for detecting substandard and falsified drugs were identified primarily through literature reviews. Key-informant interviews with experts augmented our methods when warranted. In order to aid comparisons, technologies were assigned a suitability score for use in LMIC ranging from 0–8. Scores measured the need for electricity, need for sample preparation, need for reagents, portability, level of training required, and speed of analysis. Technologies with higher scores were deemed the most feasible in LMICs. We categorized technologies that cost $10,000 USD or less as low cost, $10,000–100,000 USD as medium cost and those greater than $100,000 USD as high cost technologies (all prices are 2013 USD). This search strategy yielded information on 42 unique technologies. Five technologies were deemed both low cost and had feasibility scores between 6–8, and an additional four technologies had medium cost and high feasibility. Twelve technologies were deemed portable and therefore could be used in the field. Many technologies can aid in the detection of substandard and falsified drugs that vary from the simplest of checklists for packaging to the most complex mass spectrometry analyses. Although there is no single technology that can serve all the requirements of detecting falsified and substandard drugs, there is an opportunity to bifurcate the technologies into specific niches to address specific sections within the workflow process of detecting products.",

        "abstrak":"Objectives To explore the molecular epidemiology of rare deafness genes in Taiwanese sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI) patients with cochlear implantation (CI) by performing massive parallel sequencing (MPS) and correlating genetic factors and CI outcomes. Methods We enrolled 41 Taiwanese non-syndromic deafness patients with CI that lacked known mutations in common deafness genes. All probands were screened by a targeted exon amplification method that used massively parallel sequencing to screen a customized panel that included 40 relatively rare non-syndromic deafness genes. Results Thirteen candidate variants in nine relatively rare deafness genes (MYO15A, TMC1, MYH14, MYO3A, ACTG1, COL11A2, DSPP, GRHL2, and WFS1) were identified in 24.4% (10\/41) of the non-syndromic deafness probands with CI. According to the ACMG Standards and Guidelines, five variants in MYO15A and ACTG1 were classified as likely pathogenic variants. Two of three multi-generational pedigrees exhibiting deafness were analyzed for the segregation of the disorder with the possible disease-causing variants. Patients with variants detected in most of the identified variant-bearing genes showed relatively good CI outcomes. Conclusions We successfully identified candidate variants in partially deaf Taiwanese probands who lacked the known mutations in common deafness genes. Comparing the progress of hearing rehabilitation in CI patients with their apparent causative variants and the expression profiles of their altered genes allowed us to speculate on how alterations in specific gene sets may influence outcomes in hearing rehabilitation after CI.",

Our patient was treated with a bisphosphonate and the prolactin antagonist, cabergoline, resulting in the inhibition of fibrous dysplasia and involution of both the prolactinoma and growth hormone excess. During a follow-up of more than two years, no severe side effects were noted.ConclusionTreatment with bisphosphonates in combination with cabergoline is a suitable option in patients with McCune-Albright syndrome, especially in order to circumvent surgical interventions in patients suffering from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia involving the skull base.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-fie patients with a mean age of 64.3 years (range 25-89) with 66 metastases of the humerus were surgically treated in a 7-year time-period and retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer were the most abundant types of primary tumour. The mean time from diagnosis of primary tumour to fist metastasis was 14.5 months (range 0-173). The mean time from diagnosis of metastasis to surgery was 21.4 months (range 0-173). 38\/28 intramedullary nails\/locking plates were used for 58\/8 manifest\/impending pathological fractures. Mean cumulative survival was 16.3 months and implant failure rate was 6.1% with a mean time from initial surgery to revision of 22.2-20.6 months. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that treatment with intramedullary fiation or cement augmented plate osteosynthesis is successful for the vast majority of patients, but thorough clinical evaluation and precise decision making adapted to the patient's estimated life expectancy must be applied to avoid overtreatment or risk of implant failure.

Mounted on the 2.1m Viper telescope, ACBAR has dedicated four years to cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations at the South Pole. We describe the focal plane reconstruction and performance of ACBAR for the 2005 austral winter. We present a new CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum for the complete ACBAR data set. The addition of data from the 2005 observing season expands the data set by 210%; and the sky coverage by 490%; over the previous ACBAR releases. The expanded data set allows us to derive a new set of band-power measurements with finer [italic l]-resolution and dramatically smaller uncertainties. In particular, the band-power uncertainties have been reduced by more than a factor of two on angular scales encompassing the third and fourth acoustic peaks and the damping tail of the CMB power spectrum. The calibration has been significantly improved from 6%; to 2.2%; in temperature by using a direct comparison between CMB anisotropy maps measured by WMAP3 and ACBAR to transfer the WMAP dipole-based calibration to ACBAR. The resulting power spectrum is consistent with theoretical predications for a spatially flat, dark energy-dominated Lambda CDM cosmology.",

Methods This study included 202 eyes of 101 subjects ranging from 10 to 40 years of age with anisometropia of 1 D or more. The subjects were divided into groups according to anisomyopia, anisoastigmatism, and anisohypermetropia. After providing informed consent, each patient underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination including cycloplegic refraction, best-corrected visual acuity, cover test, axial length (AL) measurement using A-scan ultrasound biometer, keratometry, anterior chamber depth, and central corneal thickness measurement. For each participant, the eye with greater refractive error was compared to the fellow eye via paired t-tests. Correlations between parameters were studied using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results The average age of subjects was 21.7 ± 9.3 years. Of 101 subjects, 31 had anisomyopia; 42 had anisohypermetropia; and 28 had anisoastigmatism. A predisposition toward greater myopia in right eyes was noted in anisomyopia (24 of 31 subjects, 77%). The inter-ocular acuity difference was significant in all three groups (p < 0.01). As the degree of anisometropia increased, there was significant positive correlation in the difference in AL in myopes (r = 0.863, p < 0.01) and hypermetropes (r = 0.669, p < 0.01) and the difference in corneal curvature in anisoastigmatism (r = 0.564, p = 0.002) and hypermetropes (r = 0.376, p = 0.014). A significant positive correlation was also present between the anterior chamber depth difference and refractive difference in hypermetropes (r = 0.359, p = 0.020). Conclusions This study showed that anisomyopia is correlated only with anterior chamber differences. Anisohypermetropia is correlated with AL differences as well as corneal curvature difference and anterior chamber depth difference.

        "abstrak":"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic bone disorder characterized by fractures, low bone mass, and skeletal fragility. It most commonly arises from dominantly inherited mutations in the genes COL1A1 and COL1A2 that encode the chains of type I collagen. A number of recent reports have suggested that mutations affecting the carboxyl‐terminal propeptide cleavage site in the products of either COL1A1 or COL1A2 give rise to a form of OI characterized by unusually dense bones. We have assembled clinical, biochemical, and molecular data from 29 individuals from 8 families with 7 different mutations affecting the C‐propeptide cleavage site. The phenotype was generally mild: The median height was ∼33th centile. Eighty percent of subjects had their first fracture by the age of 10 years, and one‐third had a femoral or tibial fracture by the age of 25 years. Fractures continued into adulthood, though rates varied considerably. Healing was normal and rarely resulted in long bone deformity. One‐third of subjects older than 15 years had scoliosis. The teeth and hearing were normal in most, and blue sclerae were not observed. Other features noted included fibro‐osseous dysplasia of the mandible and Achilles tendon calcification. The mean spinal bone mineral density Z‐score was +2.9 (SD 2.1) compared with –2.2 (0.7) in subjects with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency mutations. Bone mineral density distribution, assessed by quantitative backscattered electron imaging in bone showed higher levels of mineralization than found in any other disorder. Bone histology showed high trabecular volume and increased cortical thickness, with hyperosteoidosis and delayed mineralization. In vitro studies with cultured skin fibroblasts suggested that these mutations interfere with processing of the chain in which the sequence alteration occurs, but the C‐propeptide is eventually cleaved (and detectable in blood), suggesting there are alternative sites of cleavage.

On the other hand, cGMP could be involved in an inhibitory control in A. filiformis. Dibutyryl-cAMP, the cAMP analogue, and forskolin, the adenylyl cyclase activator, had no effect on maximal light emission, but the adenylyl cyclase inhibitors MDL-12,330A and SQ22,536 affected the kinetics of light production in both Ophiopsila species and strongly reduced KCl-induced luminescence in A. filiformis and O. aranea, suggesting cAMP pathway involvement in photogenesis. The phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 also strongly reduced KCl-induced luminescence in all three species but this effect seems to be unspecific since U-73343, the inactive analogue of U-73122, equally inhibited photogenesis. Therefore, the results suggest that luminescence control of A. filiformis, O. aranea and O. californica is mediated by cAMP in synergy with calcium.",

        "tahun_terbit":2012,
        "abstrak":"Background Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) causes a highly contagious often fatal disease in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry. HPAIV H5N1 also poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans. One effective way to combat avian influenza with pandemic potential is through the vaccination of poultry. Several live vaccines based on attenuated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that express influenza hemagglutinin (HA) have been developed to protect chickens or mammalian species against HPAIV. However, the zoonotic potential of NDV raises safety concerns regarding the use of live NDV recombinants, as the incorporation of a heterologous attachment protein may result in the generation of NDV with altered tropism and\/or pathogenicity. Methodology\/Principal Findings In the present study we generated recombinant NDVs expressing either full length, membrane-anchored HA of the H5 subtype (NDV-H5) or a soluble trimeric form thereof (NDV-sH53). A single intramuscular immunization with NDV-sH53 or NDV-H5 fully protected chickens against disease after a lethal challenge with H5N1 and reduced levels of virus shedding in tracheal and cloacal swabs. NDV-sH53 was less protective than NDV-H5 (50% vs 80% protection) when administered via the respiratory tract. The NDV-sH53 was ineffective in mice, regardless of whether administered oculonasally or intramuscularly. In this species, NDV-H5 induced protective immunity against HPAIV H5N1, but only after oculonasal administration, despite the poor H5-specific serum antibody response it elicited. Conclusions\/Significance Although NDV expressing membrane anchored H5 in general provided better protection than its counterpart expressing soluble H5, chickens could be fully protected against a lethal challenge with H5N1 by using the latter NDV vector. This study thus provides proof of concept for the use of recombinant vector vaccines expressing a soluble form of a heterologous viral membrane protein. Such vectors may be advantageous as they preclude the incorporation of heterologous membrane proteins into the viral vector particles.",

        "abstrak":"PURPOSE\nPatients with cancer frequently use herbal supplements and concomitant medications along with antineoplastic agents. These patients are at high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDIs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to determine clinically relevant DDIs and HDIs leading to pharmaceutical intervention.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients starting a new anticancer therapy were asked to complete a questionnaire to identify concomitant use of any over-the-counter drug or herbal supplement. Potential DDIs and HDIs were identified using two different databases. If a potentially clinically relevant DDI was recognized by the clinical pharmacist, a notification was sent to the prescribing oncologist, who decided whether to carry out a suggested intervention. Regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with clinically relevant DDIs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 149 patients were included in this study, with 36 potentially clinically relevant DDIs identified in 26 patients (17.4%; 95% CI, 11.3% to 23.5%), all of them leading to therapy modifications. In total, four patients (2.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 5.3%) had experienced clinical consequences from DDIs at the time of pharmacist notification. Additionally, 84 patients (56.4%; 95% CI, 48.4% to 64.4%) reported using concurrent herbal supplements, and 122 possible HDIs were detected. Concomitant use of two or more drugs was independently associated with high risk of a clinically significant DDI (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.08 to 5.91; P = .03).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPotentially clinically relevant DDIs and possible HDIs were frequently detected in this prospective study. A multidisciplinary approach is required to identify and avoid potentially harmful combinations with anticancer therapy.",

The tube diameter, tube length, shell types etc. are all standardized and are available only in certain sizes and geometry. And so the design of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger usually involves a trial and error procedure where for a certain combination of the design variables the heat transfer area is calculated and then another combination is tried to check if there is any possibility of increasing the heat transfer coefficient. Since several discrete combinations of the design configurations are possible, the designer needs an efficient strategy to quickly locate the design configuration having the minimum heat exchanger cost.

        "tahun_terbit":2015,
        "abstrak":"In the design of revetment engineering under wave action, to resist the wave action, the pattern of top layer-filter layer-core (subsoil) is often adopted. In general, the structure of top layer is usually single discrete blocks, typically accropode blocks, four-leg square hollow blocks and barrier boards, and also acropode, riprap, paved rock blocks or concrete slabs with smaller waves. Such top layer has been provided with many research findings on its stability and is widely used in engineering. Setting a filter layer between the top layer and the lower dike core mainly has two functions: (1) giving certain permeability, to minimize the hydrodynamic load directly acting on the lower foundation soil; (2) giving certain hydraulic tightness, to prevent fine sediment of the lower foundation soil from being washed out. This paper is focused on a special filter layer with geotextile as its upper structure and coarse aggregate as its lower structure. By simulating geotextile with different permeability and coarse aggregate with different size, the pressure of top of cover layer and the down side of the geotextile is tested under wave actions, and compared with theoretical analysis, in this way, how the permeability of geotextile impacts the stability of top layer is studied. The research shows that when the filter layer under the geotextile has high permeability and the geotextile's permeability gets poorer, the uplift force to geotextile and the top layer will be increased under wave action, which will cause damage to the top layer when it is greater than the vertical component of the underwater gravity along the slope surface.",

        "abstrak":"Objective: The statistics on cancer imposes the urge to extend new methods to control this deadly form of the disease. Phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome 10q23 (PTEN) is inactivated in a subset and AKT is frequently activated in cancer. The PTEN is the central negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\/AKT signaling cascade that influences multiple cellular functions including cell growth, survival, proliferation and migration in a context-dependent manner. Dysregulation of this signaling pathway contributes to different types of cancers. The objective of the study is to explore the anti-cancer potential of thymoquinone (TQ) by analyzing the interaction between TQ with the target protein PTEN. Methods: The three dimensional structure of TQ is designed using in-silico methods, and the structure of PTEN is obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information against protein data bank. The query sequence from 8 to 353 amino acids was found to be 85% homologous to ID5R. For the target protein PTEN with 403 residues, protein families analysis covered the important domains in PTEN. Result: TQ showed the binding energy of −7.37 Kcal\/mol against PTEN with three hydrogen bonds. Conclusion: Present study suggests that TQ might inhibit abnormal cell proliferation occurring in cancer by modulating the activity of PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K\/AKT pathway.

        "abstrak":"Objective. Colonization of the colorectal mucosa with spirochetes is very rare. Owing to the small number of cases, it is not clear from the currently available publications whether spirochetes colonizing the colorectal mucosa are harmless commensals or pathogenic organisms. Furthermore, the reported complaints of these patients cannot be pooled to identify a characteristic complex of symptoms. The aim of the present work was to describe the symptoms associated with intestinal spirochetosis in a population of 209 patients, and to elucidate the effect of antibiotic treatment on these symptoms. Material and methods. A total of 209 carefully processed questionnaires providing information on the symptoms, treatment and post-treatment symptoms of patients with spirochetosis were evaluated statistically and descriptively with the aid of the SPSS program, and the results were compared with those reported in the currently available literature. Results. Of the 209 patients 168 (80.4%) were males, and the average age of the entire population at establishment of the diagnosis was 50.75 years. The most common symptoms reported were abdominal pain (46%), diarrhoea (51%) and alternating diarrhoea and constipation (13%). In this population, homosexuality and HIV infection played only a small role (6.5% homosexual patients, 3.8% HIV infected). In 72 of the 84 patients who received treatment (86%), the antibiotic employed was metronidazole, and the symptoms improved in 44 of the 84 patients (5%). Twenty-six of the 84 patients (30.9%) were investigated by colonoscopy\/biopsy after receiving medical treatment. Biopsies in 20 of these patients no longer revealed infection with spirochetes, and symptoms were found to have improved in 11 of the 20 patients (55%). Conclusions. If intestinal spirochetosis is diagnosed to be the sole intestinal pathology in symptomatic patients, the bacteria should be eradicated with metronidazole and a colonoscopy\/biopsy follow-up performed, where indicated, in patients with persisting symptoms. Significant results regarding symptoms and treatment of intestinal spirochetosis can be achieved only in a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study. In view of the low prevalence of this condition, such a study is difficult to implement.",

The global stability of the model is analyzed in terms of two threshold parameters, namely, basic reproduction number, R 0 and immune response reproduction number, R 1 . The obtained results signify that the infection dies out if R 0 ≤ 1 and persists if R 0 > 1 . We establish that the global dynamic behavior of the model has no concern with the efficacy of the nonlytic component. Numerical simulations are performed to support our theoretical findings and to investigate the effects of lytic and nonlytic components on the viral dynamics model. A comparison of two different viral infection models has been performed to illustrate the effect of viral replication inhibition through nonlytic effector mechanism on the infection dynamics. Moreover, a case study of HIV-1 infected humanized mice is presented and the result manifests that the model can fairly demonstrate the chronic stage of HIV-1 infection in humanized mice.",

Having opened the recruiting centre in central Stockholm on the first day of the SovietFinnish War, the Swedish government concluded, that the volunteers did not break the state’s neutral status, and allowed placing the recruiting posters on public transport. By January 1940, there were as many as 120+ recruitment points in Sweden. The Swedish Volunteer Corps included representatives of all strata of the Swedish society. But there were few professional soldiers or people who had experience of military service among the volunteers. Only a minor part of the volunteers were trained enough to fight in difficult winterconditions. Despite the fact that short duration of this war opposed the Swedish Volunteer Corps to be most vividly in evidence in the course of battling, it became a symbol of a special, very close relationship between Sweden and Finland. It influenced the culture of both Nordic countries because it were the Swedish volunteers who constituted the vast majority of the foreign volunteers’ total number taking part in the SovietFinnish War of 1939-1940 on Finland’s side.",

        "abstrak":"The study Social Capital and Earnings Inequalities addresses two questions. (1) Is it true that good jobs in Hungary can be obtained through friends and relatives? (2) Why do personal connections help people to get a good job? The theoretical part of the book is concerned with the second question. A distinction is made between two mechanisms that might generate contact effects: particularism (personal contacts push employers towards hiring a friend instead of other applicants) and intensive search (contacts reduce the uncertainty of employers with respect to the abilities of applicants). After a comprehensive review of existing theories, hypotheses are derived in order to disentangle these mechanisms. The first reseach question and the hypotheses are examined using a rather unique data set about young job seekers who completed secondary vocational education in 1998. The findings are the following. First, personal contacts help people to find good jobs. It is found that both high status contacts and employee referrals are helpful to find jobs in firms and occupations which are likely to provide long-term earning advantages. Additionally, high status contacts inform job seekers about opportunities that are associated with better earnings opportunities, and employee referrals increase the chances of keeping the job. Second, network resources do not have an influence on the chances of finding a job through high status persons or employee referrals, thus inequalities in network resources do not contribute to actual earnings inequalities. Finally, evidence does not support our hypotheses that would discriminate between the particularism and the intensive search mechanisms. Therefore it remains unknown why good jobs can be accessed through high status contacts and employee referrals.",

Physical activity was measured using a questionnaire and environmental (perceived environmental characteristics) and psychosocial (self-efficacy, social support from parents and friends for physical activity) factors with previously validated scales. Perceived environmental characteristics were not directly associated with the levels of physical activity, but exhibited significant indirect associations, mediated by self-efficacy in males. Self-efficacy and social support were positively and directly associated with physical activity levels, and part of the associations between social support and physical activity was mediated by self-efficacy. Perception of self-efficacy and social support, important factors associated with physical activity levels in adolescents, should be the target of interventions aimed at increasing physical activity. Favorable environments for physical activity also need to be considered, since they have a positive influence on the self-efficacy of adolescents.",

        "abstrak":"When an opioid capable of forming active metabolites is administered, the total pharmacology is the result of interactions of the opioid and such metabolites, especially normetabolites. Normetabolites may affect the morphine-like characteristics of certain opioids and thus influence their reinforcement in animals and man. Most opioids, when administered in single doses, are positively reinforcing in addicts. Oral administration, as compared with parenteral, facilitates the formation of normetabolites. When chronically administered, many opioids, including acetylmethadol, meperidine, morphine, codeine, propoxyphene, and levorphanol, show evidence of a longer half-life for their normetabolites. Normetabolites may have aversive characteristics and thus impair positive reinforcement of the parent drug in animals and man. For example, addicts do not like chronic oral morphine or chronic oral codeine. Conversely, methadone, the normetabolites of which are inactive, is well accepted during chronic oral administration. Drugs which inhibit N-demethylation will increase the agonist potency of opioids having inactive normetabolites (e.g., methadone) but will decrease the agonist potency of opioids having more potent normetabolites than the parent (e.g., acetylmethadol). The divergent responses of addicts to single doses of opiates as compared with chronic doses indicate that chronic addiction tests in man are needed befored relative abuse liability can be predicted.",

The descriptive goal is to identify the paradigm of adnominal and agentive-adverbial intensifiers in Mandarin and to determine the individual conditions of their use. On the theoretical side, I apply the analysis of intensifiers as lexicalizations of the identity function first proposed for German to the Chinese case. The identity function takes referential DPs as arguments, or, in the agentive-adverbial use, the agentive Voice head. The identity function in itself is semantically inert, but if the intensifier is focused, alternatives to the identity function come into play. These alternatives are used to explain the contextualization patterns attested for intensifier sentences. Two competing approaches to Mandarin intensifiers are reviewed and found not to be sufficient to account for the data.",

Adsorption and zeta potential measurements reveal that α-dependent adsorption of poly(acrylic acid) is the key factor that controls the rheology of the slurries. The difference in α of the slurry results in a significant difference in the surface roughness and the carbon black particle distribution in the electrode.

The analogous dependence for the work of formation of ionic aggregates has been examined with regard to existence of two variables of a state of an ionic aggregate, the aggregation numbers of surface active ions and counterions. To verify the thermodynamic models, the molecular dynamics simulations of micellization in nonionic and ionic surfactant solutions at two total surfactant concentrations have been performed. It was shown that for nonionic surfactants, even at relatively high total surfactant concentrations, the shape and behavior of the work of polydisperse micelle formation found within the model of the ideal solution at different total surfactant concentrations agrees fairly well with the numerical experiment. For ionic surfactant solutions, the numerical results indicate a strong screening of ionic aggregates by the bound counterions. This fact as well as independence of the coefficient in the law of mass action for ionic aggregates on total surfactant concentration and predictable behavior of the \"waterfall\" lines of surfaces of the aggregation work upholds the model of \"dressed\" ionic aggregates.",

If, in a warmer world, bacteria decompose organic soil matter faster, releasing carbon dioxide, this will set up a positive feedback loop, speeding up global warming. I was stunned to learn, from an article by Charles Tarnocai of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in Ottawa and his colleagues, that the global mass of soil carbon needs to be revised upwards by a frightening amount: from the 2,500 billion tonnes of carbon previously accounted for to more than 4,000 billion tonnes (C. Tarnocai et al. Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles doi:10.1029\/2008GB003327; 2009). This is a result of the previously overlooked presence of vast amounts of peat, Siberian yedoma deposits (organic-rich permafrost) and other frozen carbon stores at high latitudes. These massive stores deserve special attention because the boreal and arctic regions that house many of them are expected to warm more rapidly than average in the coming decades. Even a small leakage from these stores could cause an explosion in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 as well as methane, a potent greenhouse gas emitted by flooded thawed soils. So what do these findings mean for the role of high latitudes in the Earth system? We need more extensive field observations to monitor the stability of frozen carbon, and studies to measure the decomposition rates of such stores. And we should incorporate these processes into climate models such as those used by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If I had to pick just one new PhD subject right now, exploring this terra incognita of frozen carbon and its impact on climate change would be the one. MATERIALS",

The applied research method is statistical analysis (SPSS) of data obtained from questionnaire distributed in 2018 (mixed mode: CATI + CAWI method) to respondents from representative sample of 297 Polish INVs. The relationship between variables related to strategies and market performance measures shows weak correlations in line with the hypotheses: positive correlations with increasing adaptation, positive correlations with increasing differentiation, positive correlations with broadening vision of the market. Cluster analysis made it possible to identify a disadvantageous mix of strategies: The strongest product standardization combined with the weakest product differentiation together with addressing commercial efforts to niche markets led to the lowest results on all market performance measures. A non-segmentation approach led to the best results in 3 out of 4 market performance measures.",

My theoretical framework is a continuum between two theories: intergovernmentalism and supranationalism. My aim is to find out which of these theories better describes the development, current situation and the foreseeable future of the CFSP.I also explore the structural possibilities for working foreign policy and contemplate its meaning for the whole integration process. My method is purely analytical, using the findings of my material and previously done research. I have used as material Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and the European Council Declarations of Cologne and Helsinki. Theories have been presented using the prominent writers of each theoretical tradition, e.g. Andrew Moravcsik, Michael Smith and Paul Pierson. My case study is Yugoslavian conflict in the 1990's, beginning from Bosnia and ending to Kosovo. My intention has been to use it as an example of functioning of the CFSP, and analyse the reasons for its failure. I also present the current security situation in Europe as a context in which the CFSP is supposed to work. The question of European security brings up the need and the obstacles in the way of security co-operation. I have emphasised the relationship between the EU and the NATO, as they create the balance in Western security hemisphere. Here I am using the new framework for security by Barry Buzan and his colleagues. My conclusions show that although the CFSP has been unable to fulfil the expectations of the Maastricht Treaty, and has faced difficulties in overcoming the intergovernmentalist practises, it has over the past year taken a step towards supranationalism somewhat unexpectedly.The leaders of the EU have found the need of developing common defense policy along with the deepening integration.",

The case group was 183 male patients with silicosis and the control group was 111 male silica-exposed but without silicosis miners. Data on total dust concentrations was collected to estimate cumulative total dust exposure (CTE) of each subject and each person's characteristics and work history were obtained from questionnaire. Polymerase chain reaction re-strained fragment length polymorphism technique (PCR-RFLP) was applied to detect the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FAS-1377, FAS-670 and FASL-844. Associations between polymorphisms and risk of silicosis and stages, interactions between polymorphisms, between polymorphisms and CTE and smoking and haplotypes were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no differences in the FAS-1377, FAS-670 and FASL-844 genotypes between the case group and the control group (P > 0.05). No association was observed between FAS-1377, FAS-670 and FASL-844 polymorphisms and silicosis and stages (P > 0.05). The frequencies of FAS-1377G\/-670G haplotype in the cases (9.6%) were higher than those in the controls (3.6%) (P < 0.05). No interactions between the polymorphisms of different genes, the gene polymorphism and the total accumulative total dust, the gene polymorphism and smoking were observed (P > 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFAS-1377, FAS-670 and FASL-844 polymorphisms are not susceptible factors of silicosis. The FAS-1377G\/-670G haplotype might be a susceptibility marker of silicosis.",

Lithium was the gold standard of treatment for bipolar disorder, but a number of studies over the past several decades shown that many drugs with antiepileptic properties are effective in the treatment of some patients with bipolar affective disorder, especially for those whose disorder inadequately responds to lithium, and those who are intolerant of treatment with lithium.

Methods: 68Ga-DOTATATE PET\/CT was used to examine 105 patients, 35 of whom had been pretreated with long-acting octreotide. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of target tissues, as well as metastases, was compared between the groups of patients with (group 1) and without (group 2) octreotide treatment. Results: The SUVmax of the spleen and liver was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (both P < 0.001). There were no significant group differences in SUVmax for primary tumors (28.6 ± 6.8 vs. 32.9 ± 31.5) or metastases in the liver (27.2 ± 14.8 vs. 25.7 ± 10.7), lymph nodes (41.4 ± 19.5 vs. 25.0 ± 6.3), or skeleton (39.5 ± 22.0 vs. 15.4 ± 7.8). In 9 patients available for intraindividual comparison, tumor uptake was unaffected by treatment with somatostatin analogs (21.7 vs. 20.6; P = 0.93).

Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent alpha characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, r(2)(t) approximately t(alpha). We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400 g\/l is subdiffusive (alpha < 1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent alpha decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, alpha reaches a limit value of alpha(l) approximately 3\/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on diffusion.",

Previous work has shown that enhancing synaptic levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in healthy human adults with donepezil (trade name: Aricept) can increase the magnitude and specificity of perceptual learning (PL) for motion direction discrimination in the perifovea. In the current study, we ask whether increasing the synaptic levels of ACh in healthy human adults with donepezil boosts learning of low-contrast isolated letter identification and high-contrast flanked letter identification in normal peripheral vision. Two groups of observers performed sequential training over multiple days while ingesting donepezil. One group trained on isolated low-contrast letters in Phase 1 and crowded high-contrast letters in Phase 2, and the other group performed the reverse sequence, thereby enabling us to differentiate possible effects of drug and training order on PL of letter identification. All testing and training were performed monocularly in peripheral vision, at an eccentricity of 10 degrees along the lower vertical meridian. Our experimental design allowed us to evaluate the effects of sequential training and to ask whether increasing cholinergic signaling boosted learning and\/or transfer of low-contrast isolated letter identification and high-contrast flanked letter identification in normal peripheral vision. We found that both groups improved on each of the two tasks. However, our results revealed an effect of training task order on flanked letter identification: Observers who trained on isolated targets first showed rapid early improvement in flanked letter identification but little to no additional improvement after 30 training blocks, while observers who first trained with flanked letters improved gradually on flanked letter identification over the entire 100-block course of training. In addition, we found no effect of donepezil on PL of either isolated or flanked letter identification. In other words, donepezil neither boosted nor blocked learning to identify isolated low-contrast letters or learning to uncrowd in normal peripheral vision.",

The evidence supporting a causal role for lower circulating T, or its metabolites dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol, in the genesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men is limited. Observational studies associate low baseline T levels with carotid atherosclerosis, aortic and peripheral vascular disease, and with the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality. Studies using mass spectrometry suggest that when total T is assayed optimally, calculation of free T might not necessarily improve risk stratification. There is limited evidence to support an association of estradiol with CVD. Interventional studies of T therapy in men with coronary artery disease have shown beneficial effects on exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. However, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of T therapy in men with the prespecified outcomes of cardiovascular events or deaths are lacking. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of T published up to 2010 found no increase in cardiovascular events, mortality, or prostate cancer with therapy. Recently, in a trial of older men with mobility limitations, men randomized to receive a substantial dose of T reported cardiovascular adverse effects. This phenomenon was not reported from a comparable trial where men received a more conservative dose of T, suggesting a prudent approach should be adopted when considering therapy in frail older men with existing CVD.

Several amino acids appeared to be incorporated into the protein to a significant extent, without degradation or conversion. Among these were the aromatic amino acids, L‐tyrosine and L‐phenylalanine. Using the same replacement approach, their incorporation into PQQ was determined by 1H‐ and 13C‐NMR spectroscopy of purified PQQ obtained from the culture medium. It appeared that the complete carbon skeleton of tyrosine was present, forming the o‐quinone and pyrrole‐2‐carboxylic acid moieties in PQQ, while phenylalanine was not incorporated at all.

This concerns the A function of the stimuli in the individual's motivational system. The second function of the stimuli in the motivational system, given to the stimuli as a result of the attitudinal function, is that the stimuli will serve as reinforcing stimuli for the individual. This concerns the R function of the motivational system. In addition to this, stimuli that have the A and the R functions will also have a third function for the individual. 'ouch stimuli will elicit (or control) behaviors. That is, as soon as a stimulus comes to elicit a positive emotional response through classical conditioning the stimulus will thereby acquire the power of controlling instrumental responses in the individual that approach the stimulus. The converse is true for negative A-R-D stimuli. The implications of this learning theory are elaborated in the context of presenting a theory of human motivation. The theory of human motivation is then employed to better understand a number of areas of importance to personality study, including an understanding of abnormal behavior in terms of the A-R-D (motivational) system and the present and potential roles of behavior therapy and behavior moJification in dealing with personality problems.",

Phages specific to R. loti strains were shown to induce the phage lysis of several Astragalus, Hedysarum and Ononis rhizobia. Ten R. loti strains tested for nodulation abilities on the plant hosts under investigation were able to develop nitrogen-fixing nodules on the Ononis arvensis roots. On the other hand, rhizobia from Ononis and Glycyrrhiza could form an effective symbiosis with Lotus corniculatus plants, so these bacteria are considered to belong to the Rhizobium loti taxon. Bacterial strains isolated from Astragalus and Hedysarum were observed to cross-nodulate their plant hosts as well as Oxytropis campestris, Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Ononis arvensis plants, whereas they could not nodulate Lotus plants.

Determinations of permeation and diffusion coefficient have been made by a very sensitive electrochemical method at room temperature, and in some cases with temperatures up to 80°C, for platinum, nickel, tantalum, titanium, zirconium, manganese, and iron-chromium alloys. The dependence of permeation at high cds on time varies qualitatively with the metal involved. The diffusion coefficient for iron-chromium alloys decreases with increasing chromium; the solubility increases with increasing chromium. In general, the solubility decreases with increasing heat of absorption, and decreases with decreasing d-vacancies. The diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing latent heat of sublimation of the metal. The critical concentration of hydrogen that causes embrittlement in the metal is interpreted in terms of a model involving the pressure of hydrogen in voids. Qualitative support is cited. Gas-phase heats of solution of hydrogen in metals are those obtained for the solution case. Solubility of hydrogen depends upon d-vacancies according to a simple model. A solution of equations relating to the diffusion of hydrogen out of pre-charged metal foils is given.",

While the stretch modulus shows a peak at a value of surfactant-to-hydrotrope concentration ratio ( R) close to unity as expected due to neutralization of head-group charge at R = 1, the breaking stress and scission energy produce a peak at R < 1.0 because of thinning of the micelle diameter with increased R. The breaking stress from the simulations depends on the rate of deformation and roughly agrees with the experimental values of Rothstein ( J.

It is a nurse's obligation to be familiar with the state laws that apply to the adolescents they will encounter. It must be clearly understood that if the state has no parental involvement laws, it is a breach of patient confidentiality to notify parents. Retaining custody simply involves the mother keeping the child and raising it even though it is illegitimate. However, illegitimate children are today extended the rights and privileges of legitimate children e.g., inheritance, insurance benefits, and standing to sue in civil actions. Paternity can be either admitted to or demonstrated. Adoption laws vary tremendously by state, but they all function similarly in that the mother must sign away her right to custody. Some states allow for this to be revoked if the mother has somehow been forced or deceived into signing. Marriage is another option, however in most states the mother and father must be 18.

        "tahun_terbit":2001,
        "abstrak":"BRCA2 is one of the best-known genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer, yet we know remarkably little about its role in the cell. Despite its large size (390 kDa), BRCA2 contains no obvious homology to known sequences — a fact that has eluded many previous attempts to characterize its function. It has been linked to both transcriptional regulation and DNA repair, but we still know relatively little about how loss of BRCA2 disrupts these processes. Now, reporting in Cell, Marmorstein and colleagues have isolated the multiprotein complex that BRCA2 resides in, and they show that it binds directly to a DNA-binding protein, BRCA2-associated factor 35 (BRAF35). What’s more, they have identified a new function for BRCA2 — mediating timely progression into mitosis. To track down the elusive factors that interact with BRCA2, the authors used affinity purification. They found that BRCA2 is present in a 2 MDa complex. Within this complex, they identified BRAF35, an evolutionarily conserved protein that contains a high mobility group (HMG) domain. They then showed, using a pulldown assay, that BRCA2 and BRAF35 interact directly. Interestingly, BRAF35 is also present in a second complex that does not contain BRCA2. Because HMG domains are implicated in mediating binding at DNA junctions, they wondered whether BRAF35 might bind selectively to specific types of DNA. And they found, consistent with such a role, that BRAF35 is an architectural DNA-binding protein that binds cruciform DNA — the type of structure formed at junctions. Next, Marmostein and colleagues asked whether BRAF35 and BRCA2 are expressed together in vivo. Using in situ hybridization to mouse embryos, they found that both are expressed most highly in rapidly dividing cells. To look more closely at the subcellular localization, the authors examined mitotic HeLa cells using indirect immunofluorescence, and found that BRAF35 and BRCA2 both localize to mitotic chromosomes during initiation of chromosome condensation. This localization suggests a role for BRCA2 in cell-cycle progression — a function that they confirmed by antibodyinjection experiments. Here, injection of antibodies against either BRCA2 or BRAF35 resulted in a G2 delay in HeLa cells. So it seems that this complex might have a dual function in regulating both DNA repair and the cell cycle. Many questions have now been raised. For instance, can this complex bind to the DNA junctions that are formed during DNA repair? Does BRAF35 mediate interaction of BRCA2 with DNA for all BRCA2’s functions? Now that the identity of BRCA2’s cohorts has been unveiled, the answers to these questions are likely to come pouring in. Alison Schuldt",

The results showed at least 24 metabolites that were significantly modified in the group of atherosclerotic patients by this nontargeted procedure. Most of the changes can be associated to alterations of the metabolism characteristics of insulin resistance that can be strongly related to the metabolic syndrome. In addition, correlations among variables accounting for the classification show amino acids as variables whose changes showed a high degree of correlation.

The giant cell tumour (GCT) is a benign locally aggressive neoplasm located near the articular end of tubular bones. Both lesions are characterised histologically by multinucleated giant cells in a background of ovoid to spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells. There is a basic question whether both lesions are separate entities or variants of the same disease. The study of cell cycle-associated proteins may give insights into clarifying such question. The expression of these proteins is also important to determine the cell cycle regulation in both tumours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of p53, MDM2, Ki-67 and PCNA in CGCG and GCT. The results demonstrated that, despite the lack of p53 immunoreactivity, all the samples showed wide expression of MDM2. The percentage of Ki-67- and PCNA-positive cells in CGCG was statistically higher than that of GCT Our findings show that CGCG has a higher proliferative activity compared with that of the GCT. Our results also suggest that p53 inactivation by MDM2 expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of giant cell lesions of the jaws and long bones.",

Hepatitis B and hepatitis C (HCV) are two major risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are responsible for 70–80 % of cases seen worldwide. The incidence of HCC has been rising in the USA over the last several decades, largely in part to the prevalence of HCV-induced cirrhosis. Curative therapies with resection and orthotopic liver transplantation are only available for individuals with early-stage HCC, and disease recurrence is still common after treatment, highlighting the need for both primary and secondary preventative measures. Despite the low rates of viral eradication with interferon-based regimens, many studies have shown a chemo-protective effect in patients who do achieve a sustained virologic response. The emergence of new direct-acting antiviral agents with cure rates above 95 % has the potential to change the landscape of HCV-induced HCC.

The objective was support pulmologists, critical care physicians or anesthetists to analyze the different units of pressure, currently used in hospitals, to indicate type of units and to use mnemonic methods of conversion. The Brazilian National Agency (CONMETRO) determines that pascal (Pa) - the unit of pressure of the International System (IS) - must be used. Neverthless, it is temporarily accepted the use of others units such as atmosphere, bar, Torr, and mmHg. This Agency also establishes how to write these units. It is important to note that the pneumatic medical devices are all standardized to be connected into a system with 3.45kgf\/ cm 2 of pressure, which is equivalent to 50psi or 340kPa (IS). These units can be easily converted and the site http\/\/www.webcalc.com.br can be accessed for rapid conversion. In conclusion, the use of several units of pressure brings shortcomings for the doctor to interpret results.

However, these studies were unable to reconstruct the ancestral avian host lineage for feather lice. Here we use genome sequences of a broad diversity of lice to reconstruct a phylogeny based on 1,075 genes. By comparing this louse evolutionary tree to the avian host tree, we show that feather lice began diversifying on the common ancestor of waterfowl and landfowl, then radiated onto other avian lineages by extensive host-switching. Dating analyses and cophylogenetic comparisons revealed that two of three lineages of birds that diverged before the K-Pg boundary acquired their feather lice after this event via host-switching.Robert de Moya et al. use comparative genomics of avian lice to reconstruct the phylogeny of these parasites.

Previous reconstruction-based SR approaches focus more on the optimization models but have not adequately emphasized the mathematic-solving techniques for this typically ill-conditioned and under-determined large scale problem. Since step size plays an important role in the iterative SR process, and there is a tradeoff between less computation cost and higher accuracy, conventional SR methods either adopt a fixed step size to obtain a higher running speed, or use a computationally expensive line search algorithm to pursue an improvement in accuracy. Taking both cues into consideration, in this paper, we propose an adaptive line search strategy to realize the fast convergence of reconstruction-based SR. The approximate analytical expression of step size is introduced to prevent us from setting it empirically or running iterations to test a proper one. We further modify the proposed strategy to be more adaptive under different SR conditions. Using our strategy, one can accelerate the SR process and obtain the optimal solution with less iteration. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic data sets and real-world scenes.

        "tahun_terbit":2017,
        "abstrak":"Some have proposed that all psychotherapies for depression, as well as for other common mental disorders, are equally efficacious and that they all work through common processes, especially a relationship with a therapist. One reason it may be difficult to discern differential efficacy among treatments, as well as how they exert their effects, is that depression and other disorders are heterogeneous in both presentation and prognosis. The studies presented in the dissertation aimed to explore how heterogeneity in depression may moderate treatment effects and process-outcome relations. In study 1, a prognostic index (PI) was developed and treatment differences along the PI were explored in a sample of patients (N = 622) randomized to treatment as usual (TAU) or stepped care starting with brief therapy (BT) or with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The PI comprised five variables: unemployment status, depression severity, hostility, sleep problems, and lower positive emotionality, all of which predicted a lower likelihood of recovery. For patients whose PI indicated a high likelihood of recovery (73% of the sample), recovery rates were similarly high across the treatments. Among patients whose PI indicated a lower likelihood of recovery, patients in the CBT condition experienced a substantially higher recovery rate (65%) than patients in TAU (40%) or BT (44%). In study 2, variability in the predictive relationship between the therapeutic alliance and depressive symptom change was explored in a sample of patients receiving cognitive therapy (CT) for depression (N = 60). The alliance predicted outcome in the subgroup of clients with 0–2 prior episodes (r = .52), but not in those with 3 or more prior episodes (r = -.02). In study 3, these findings were replicated in an independent sample of patients receiving CBT for depression, but they did not extend to patients in a psychodynamic therapy condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that there may be identifiable subgroups of patients for whom factors common to all treatments will promote symptom change. By contrast, complementary subgroups, such as those with poorer prognoses or more recurrent histories of depression, may reveal differences in the efficacies of treatments and their active mechanisms.

        "abstrak":"Mastocytosis is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by abnormal accumulation and frequent activation of mast cells (MCs) in various organs. Organ systems typically involved are the bone marrow, skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract. In most adult patients, the systemic form of mastocytosis (SM) is diagnosed, which includes an indolent subvariant, an aggressive subvariant and a leukemic subvariant, also termed MC leukemia. Whereas in pediatric mastocytosis, which is usually confined to the skin, a number of different KIT mutations and other defects may be detected, the KIT mutation D816V is detectable in most (adult) patients with SM. In a subset of these patients, additional oncogenic factors may lead to enhanced survival and growth of MCs and, thus, to advanced SM. Other factors may lead to MC activation, with consecutive anaphylactic reactions that can be severe or even fatal. Treatment of SM usually focuses on symptom relief by histamine receptor antagonists and other supportive therapy. However, in aggressive and leukemic variants, cytoreductive and targeted drugs must be applied. Unfortunately, the prognosis in these patients remains poor, even when treated with novel KIT-targeting agents, polychemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. This article provides a summary of our knowledge on the pathogenesis and on treatment options in SM.",

Simulation of drilling process is an effective method in optimizing the drill geometry and process parameters in order to improve hole quality and to reduce the drill wear. In this research we have developed three-dimensional (3D) FE model for drilling CFRP. A 3D progressive intra-laminar failure model based on the Hashin’s theory is considered. Also an inter-laminar delamination model which includes the onset and growth of delamination by using cohesive contact zone is developed. The developed model with inclusion of the improved delamination model and real drill geometry is used to make comparison between the step drill of different stage ratio and twist drill. Thrust force, torque and work piece stress distributions are estimated to decrease by the use of step drill with high stage ratio. The model indicates that delamination and other workpiece defects could be controlled by selection of suitable step drill geometry. Hence the 3D model could be used as a design tool for drill geometry for minimization of delamination in CFRP drilling.",

        "tahun_terbit":2020,
        "abstrak":"Abstract In the last years, the interest regarding thermoelectric refrigerators has increased thanks to their properties such as the absence of moving parts and toxic or fire-sensitive refrigerants, robustness, and low weight. These devices are also quite flexible and may represent a suitable solution to offer grid services to proper demand response programs. In this article, an aggregation strategy is proposed to fulfil system operator requests on power deviations with limited information exchange between the aggregator and each refrigerator. Downward and upward flexibility in energy consumption can be offered, allowing an aggregated set of loads to provide balancing services such as frequency containment reserve, frequency restoration reserve or replacement reserve to the electrical grid. First, a dynamic model of a thermoelectric refrigerator is built and validated using experimental data collected from a real device under controlled and replicable experimental conditions. A modified temperature controller is proposed and an aggregation strategy with reduced communication requirements is formulated. Then, the aggregation of thermoelectric refrigerators is represented with a linear model to determine that this aggregation can behave as flexible load for reserve provision and demand response applications. It is shown through extensive simulations that a set of refrigerators can operate as in a flexible way by modifying their internal temperature set points, responding in less than 30 s to any power deviation command and sustaining the modified consumption for up to 15 min in the frequency containment and restoration reserves services, and up to 1 h in the replacement reserve service, without overshoots, rebounds, or synchronization problems.",

RARs bind both all-trans- and 9-cis-RA, whereas only the 9-cis-RA stereoisomer binds to RXRs.

This review is focused on the structure, mode of action, ligands, expression, and pharmacology of RXRs. Given their role as common partners to many other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, these receptors have been the subject of intense scrutiny. Moreover, and despite numerous studies since their initial discovery, RXRs remain enigmatic nuclear receptors, and there is still no consensus regarding their role.

        "abstrak":"This Perspective describes recent progress in the synthesis and optical characterization of high quality solution-based semiconductor nanowires (NWs). The described solution-phase NW syntheses are analogous to conventional vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth schemes for 1D materials. However, a primary difference is that low melting catalyst particles are used to induce the asymmetric crystallization of wires at temperatures sustainable by solution chemistry (T < 400 degrees C). Reactions are conducted in the presence of mild coordinating solvents such as trioctylphosphine oxide, which modulate NW growth kinetics and passivate their surfaces. This approach borrows from concurrent advances in colloidal quantum dot (QD) syntheses. In particular, the appropriate choice of solvent, coordinating ligands, growth conditions and precursors all originate from existing preparations for high quality semiconductor QDs. Subsequent structural characterization of the nanowires reveals their high degree of crystallinity, low ensemble size distributions and intrawire uniformity. Variations of these syntheses yield branched CdSe, CdTe and PbSe NWs with characteristic tripod, v-shape, y-shape, t-shape and \"higher order\" morphologies. A \"geminate\" NW nucleation mechanism is used to explain this phenomenon. The proposed branching model is also predictive and can be tested by additional nanowire syntheses that we or others conduct. Corresponding optical properties of both straight and branched wires are described, including measurements of their frequency-dependent absorption cross sections. Preliminary ensemble experiments focus on transient differential absorption measurements to study relevant carrier relaxation pathways and timescales over which these processes occur. Additional studies reveal intrawire optical heterogeneity and fluorescence intermittency at the single NW level.",

The resultant films showed a marked difference in their growth mechanisms and surface morphologies. Various carbon decorative coatings were synthesized with different surface roughness values, despite identical preparation conditions. In particular, smooth to highly rough all-carbon surfaces, as determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were readily obtained by manipulating the LbL deposition methods. As was confirmed by the AFM and SEM analyses, this finding indicated the fundamental morphological evolution of one-dimensional nano-objects (MWNT) and two-dimensional nano-objects (GO) by control of the surface roughness through the deposition method.

On the northern shore of Lake Geneva, near the City of Lausanne, the fault zone is well defined (Fig. 1). However, its extension in the lake and on its southern shore is not well known. Geology on both sides of the lake, however, indicates that major changes in the distribution of Molasse units occur in this region. Locating the Molasse fault zone across Lake Geneva would help to better understand geology and would provide important constraints on tectonic models of the Alps. In order to study the extension of the Molasse fault zone across Lake Geneva, we conducted a 2-D high-resolution multi-channel seismic reflection survey.

        "tahun_terbit":2020,
        "abstrak":"Takotsubo was initially reported as heart syndrome exhibiting acute onset with chest pain, ST elevation or depression at electrocardiography, transient apical left ventricular dysfunction, minimal enzymatic release, mimicking acute myocardial infarction, in patients without angiographic stenosis at coronary angiography.1 Initially described by Satoh et al.,2 it was named ‘takotsubo’-shaped cardiomyopathy, due to the short neck, round, flash like left ventricular (LV) apical ballooning resembling the Japanese octopus pot tako-tsubo.3 Despite takotsubo presenting as an acute coronary syndrome, it was initially reported as cardiomyopathy, given the main feature of reversible myocardial dysfunction in the presence of normal coronary arteries and myocardial damage similar to catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy.4 Furthermore, takotsubo syndrome was also assimilated to a clinical model of stress-related sudden death, since either an internal (emotional) trigger, usually characterized by loss, fear or anger, or an external (physical) trigger, due to exacerbated disorders, procedural, perioperative, acute cerebrovascular accidents, endocrine crisis of pheochromocytoma, could precipitate the syndrome. Therefore, in the first large international registry, the authors named the syndrome ‘takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy’.5 However, reversible myocardial dysfunction in the absence of coronary stenosis in a clinical setting resembling acute coronary syndrome may be due to direct myocyte injury with activation of cell survival cascade, but it might also be the result of myocardial stunning due to temporary ischaemia caused by reversible microvascular spasm. Therefore, we performed a pivotal study in women with takotsubo syndrome due to emotional trigger, undergoing myocardial contrast echocardiography 24 h after the acute event and at discharge, both at rest and during adenosine stimulation. We demonstrated a constricted microvascular network within the dysfunctional area that resolved during adenosine challenge along with myocardial dysfunction.6 Thus, at least in these emotional triggered takotsubo patients, reversible microvascular dysfunction is the pathogenetic mechanism of the syndrome, given the predominance of endothelin receptor type A and α1-receptors in the coronary microvasculature, where catecholamine and endothelin exert their vasoconstrictor effect. Since then, takotsubo syndrome has been largely recognized worldwide in several categories of patients, according to Mayo Clinic diagnostic criteria, such as: 1. the presence of a transient abnormality in LV wall motion beyond a single epicardial coronary artery perfusion territory, the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture, the presence of new electrocardiographic abnormalities or elevation in cardiac troponin level, and the absence of pheocromocytoma or myocarditis.7 Since a definite trigger cannot be found in almost 30% of cases, emotional or physical stress was not included as a diagnostic criterion. Moreover, absence of reported triggers, especially emotional ones, does not necessarily exclude their occurrence, since they might be either negated or not reported by the patients, or not asked about or overlooked by physician. Nevertheless, in the original report of the international InterTAK registry, apart from takotsubo patients diagnosed according with Mayo Clinic criteria, patients with presence of coronary artery disease, with wall motion abnormalities congruent with a single coronary artery territory and death during the acute phase before wall motion recovery were included.5 In this takotsubo patient series, not only severe in-hospital complications including shock and death were similar to patients with acute coronary syndrome, but also the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was 9.9% per patient-year and the rate of death was 5.6% per patientyear.

        "abstrak":"To the Editor: Timomen and Kauma (1) have recently reported a therapeutic effect of an intravenous administration of haem arginate in 3 out of 14 patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This seems to be an important observation. The authors attributed their results to a possible action of haem as a haemopoietic growth factor. However, they didn’t mention a recent work of ours (2) studying in vitro the globin synthesis in patients with a MDS. In this work which may offer an explanation for their findings we had determined the globin chain a\/P synthetic ratios in the reticulocytes of 30 patients with several types of MDS. These ratios were found lower than normal in 14 patients (0.46 & 0.2, imbalance of an a-thalassaemia type), normal in 1 1 ( I .O k 0.09) and higher than normal in 5 patients (1.52 k 0.21, imbalance of a P-thalassaemia type). Nearly all the FABtypes of MDS were represented in each group. In 16 of these cases the addition of exogenous haem in the incubation mixture produced a slight to pronounced increase (14350%) of the a\/P ratios, particularly in those patients with an a-thalassaemia-like disorder. We suggest that the haem-responders have a depletion of the intracellular haem due to an as yet undefined basic molecular defect, thus resembling to what happens in primary sideroblastic anaemia (3,4). It would be of great interest to study the response to haem both in vitro and in vivo in patients with an MDS. If these responses prove to be similar then the effect of the in vitro addition of haem on globin synthesis could be a useful test for predicting those patients who could be helped in vivo by haem administration.",

Although originally designed for complete model spaces,5 it has been found necessary to develop the open-shell CC theory for incomplete model spaces4,6 since otherwise there is often the danger of the intruder problem.

Simulation-based training emphasizes these skills and positively impacts patient safety. A group of Indian neonatologists in collaboration with their UK colleagues conducted adapted Neonatal Emergencies Simulation Team-training (NEST) courses in India. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of NEST courses in India and analyze the participant’s feedback Methods: A total of 16 NEST courses were conducted between November 2014 and February 2016. Structured pre- and postcourse feedback from participants was analyzed. Key domains studied included structured approach, human factors, situation-background-assessment-recommendation tool, and teamwork in an emergency. Each category was rated from 1 to 5, indicating a low to high scale. Pre- and posttraining scores and scores between centers were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively. Results: A total of 191 feedbacks from 58 nurses and 133 doctors from 4 centers were analyzed. The comparison of self-reported pre- and postcourses showed a significant improvement across all domains. There was no statistical difference between scores from different centers showing consistent course results. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that the NEST multiprofessional course can be collaboratively delivered. The analysis of feedback shows a significant improvement in the candidate’s self-reported ability across all domains related to the application of the course principles to simulated neonatal emergencies.",

Cancer occurrence was identified by linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on observed and expected numbers from rates for all Danish residents. The cohort consisted of 3,530 persons with Down syndrome contributing 89,570 person-years at risk.Results:Acute leukemia risk was highest from 1–4 years of age and remained elevated until age 30. The overall risk of solid tumors was decreased (SIR 0.45; 95% CI 0.34–0.59), especially in persons 50 years or older (SIR 0.27; 95% CI 0.16–0.43). We found a significantly lower risk of lung cancer (SIR 0.10; 95% CI 0.00–0.56), breast cancer (SIR 0.16; 95% CI 0.03–0.47), and cervical cancer (SIR 0.0; 95% CI 0.00–0.77). Testicular cancer was the only solid tumor with an increased SIR (2.9; 95% CI 1.6–4.8).Conclusions:The risk of all major groups of solid tumors was decreased, except testicular cancer. Altered screening strategies should be considered for persons with Down syndrome. This unusual pattern of cancer occurrence may help understanding carcinogenesis in the general population.Genet Med 18 11, 1151–1157.",

He initially presented to a private hospital in May 2018 with a 6-month history of chronic productive cough and haemoptysis. Chest X-Ray (CXR), CT scan, bronchoscopy, biopsy and broncho-alveolar lavage were conducted. At this stage, imaging and histopathological investigations were negative for malignancy. Diagnosis of bronchiectasis was made and he was treated with antibiotic and tranexamic acid. Due to financial difficulties, his care was transferred to a university respiratory clinic in June 2018. His condition was monitored with CXR at every visit and treatment with tranexamic acid was continued for 6 months. However, due to persistent haemoptysis, he presented to the university primary care clinic in Dec 2018. Investigations were repeated in January 2019 where his CXR showed increased opacity of the left retrocardiac region and CT scan revealed a left lower lobe endobronchial mass causing collapse with mediastinal lymphadenopathy suggestive of malignancy. Bronchoscopy, biopsy and histopathology confirmed the presence of NET. Although the Ki-67 index was low, the mitotic count, presence of necrosis and evidence of liver metastases favoured the diagnosis of AC. A positron emission tomography Ga-68 DONATOC scan showed evidence of somatostatin receptor avid known primary malignancy in the lungs with suspicions of liver metastasis. He was subsequently referred to the oncology team and chemotherapy was initiated. This case highlights the challenge in diagnosis and management of patients with AC. Physicians ought to be vigilant and have a high index of suspicion in patients who present with persistent symptoms on multiple visits. Early diagnosis of NET would prevent metastasis and provide better prognosis. Continuous follow-up shared care between primary care and secondary care physicians is also essential to provide ongoing psychosocial support for patients with NET, especially those with metastatic disease.",

To achieve this, we train a mBNF extractor using nine Southern Bantu languages that form part of the freely available multilingual NCHLT corpus. We append these mBNFs to the existing MFCCs, pitch features and i-vectors to train acoustic models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the target code-switched languages.

        "abstrak":"AIM\nThe comparative efficacy, safety and tolerability of budesonide-MMX and oral mesalamine in active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) are unclear. We conducted a network meta-analysis to fill this evidence gap.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, the Cochrane Library, clinical trial registries, regulatory agencies' websites and international conference proceedings, through July 2018, to identify randomized controlled trials of adult patients with active, mild-to-moderate UC, comparing budesonide-MMX or mesalamine against placebo, or against each other, or different dosing strategies, for induction of remission. Two reviewers independently abstracted study data and outcomes, and assessed each trial's risk-of-bias.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified and synthesized evidence from 15 eligible trials including 4,083 participants. Budesonide-MMX 9 mg\/day and mesalamine >2.4 g\/day had similar efficacy for induction of clinical and endoscopic remission (OR=0.97; 0.59-1.60), both showing superiority over placebo (OR=2.68; 1.75-4.10, and OR=2.75; 1.94-3.90, respectively). Furthermore, mesalamine >2.4 g\/day was more efficacious than mesalamine 1.6-2.4 g\/day (OR=1.27; 1.03-1.56). Secondary analyses showed that mesalamine >2.4 g\/day ranks at the top among comparator treatments regarding safety (serious adverse events; surface under the cumulative ranking area [SUCRA] 79.2%) and tolerability (treatment discontinuations or withdrawals from the study due to adverse events; SUCRA 96.7%). There was no evidence of inconsistency, while heterogeneity between studies and risk of publication bias were low.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide-MMX and mesalamine >2.4 g\/day had similar efficacy for induction of clinical and endoscopic remission in active, mild-to-moderate UC; however, mesalamine >2.4 g\/day showed better tolerability. Further high-quality research is warranted.",

Its objective was to ensure Finland’s competitiveness and to promote growth by concluding growth agreements between central government and regions, and by supporting the anticipated structural change (ERM) based on the regions’ strengths, resources and expertise. A total of EUR 30 million was available for the AIKO measure between 2016 and 2018. The objective of the assessment was to analyse how successfully the AIKO measure has promoted structural change based on regional strengths and resilience, the coordination of objectives at regional and national level, creation of new cooperation-based approaches, thereby driving regional growth, employment, competitiveness and internationalisation. The assessment has a strong development approach, and its results will be widely utilised in the reform of regional development practices and instruments. Overall, AIKO appears to have succeeded in providing regions and cities with a flexible instrument for regional development. The instrument is divided into two parts with very different objectives, but both have served a clear purpose. Its strengths include the opportunity provided by AIKO to quickly and with little administrative effort launch innovative projects based on the regions' own needs.

A comprehensive description of the experiment and the 2D data processing is given. The information content of 2D exchange spectra of powders is discussed. For discrete jump motions, 2D powder spectra exhibit characteristic ridge patterns originating from the singularities of the 2D lineshape. From the geometry of such ridge patterns the angles of reorientation of the electric field gradient tensors can be determined directly, thus yielding information about the type of motion. The method is illustrated by two examples: the two-site jump of dimethyl sulfone and the six-site jump of hexamethylbenzene.",

Epsin is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, and these post-translational modifications are necessary for the regulation of endocytosis. Since human Epsin (hEpsin) has two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), we investigated the roles of these UIMs in endocytosis. hEpsin formed a complex with ubiquitinated proteins but did not bind to monoubiquitin. Neither of the two UIMs of hEpsin alone was sufficient to form a complex with ubiquitinated proteins: both UIMs were necessary. Mutations of Asp209 and Asp210 to Ala in UIM (hEpsinDA) abolished the binding activity of hEpsin to ubiquitinated proteins. However, hEpsinDA interacted with Eps15, POB1, and AP-2, which are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis, as efficiently as wild-type hEpsin. Expression of hEpsinDA in CHO-IR cells affected neither the binding of insulin to nor insulin-dependent autophosphorylation of its receptor. Expression of wild-type hEpsin inhibited the internalization of insulin, whereas that of hEpsinDA did not. These results suggest that the UIM motifs of hEpsin interact with proteins modified with ubiquitin, and that the complex formation is involved in insulin-dependent receptor endocytosis.",

The possibility for the geometric breaking of the global conservation laws of the covariant divergence free currents is shown not to exist: their charges if defined and comparable at in and out states are also conserved. It is found that for localized external sources and gauge fields only one of the currents, the Yang-Mills current, leads to a nonvanishing total charge. A gauge-invariant definition is given for the internal charge carried by the gauge field itself. It is shown that the components of the gauge field giving rise to the internal charge satisfy Maxwell's equations either everywhere or at large distances from the source region. This indicates that the gauge field can account only for electric charge.",

The animals kept on the high fat, low choline diet showed severe fatty metamorphosis of the liver, a decreased hepatic lecithin concentration, and a twofold increase in the relative specific activity of lecithin. Estradiol inhibited fatty metamorphosis and increased the lecithin concentration slightly. The animals receiving a vitamin Blrsupplemented diet and estradiol showed the greatest lipotropic effect and an increased liver lecithin concentration. Estradiol alone, or combined with vitamin B,?, did not correct the apparent choline deficiency, as meaaued by the abnormally high rate of P32 incorporation into lecithin. The results suggest, therefore, that the prevention of fatty livers by estradiol depends on mechanisms other than those involved in the lipotropic properties of choline or vitamin B12.",

        "tahun_terbit":2017,
        "abstrak":"Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) often presents as high grade, poorly differentiated tumors resulting in a more aggressive disease for which accurate and timely diagnosis is critical to treatment selection or clinical trial enrollment. Furthermore, the high rate of distant metastases and absence of breast-specific immunohistochemical markers that contribute to diagnostic uncertainty may delay or limit treatment modalities that can lead to poorer outcomes. The 92-gene assay is an RT-PCR-based cancer classifier that previously demonstrated 80% accuracy for the diagnosis of breast cancer. In this study, blinded validation of an optimized algorithm and assay specifically developed to improve performance in TNBC is described. Methods: To increase clinical scope for the diagnosis of TNBC, formalin fixed paraffin embedded specimens (N=103) representing a range of breast tumor histologies (e.g. TNBC, adenoid cystic, neuroendocrine, metaplastic, lobular, mucinous, DCIS) were added to the tumor reference database. A revised computational algorithm was constructed by the integration of machine learning techniques. For validation, tumor specimens (N=160) of TNBC (57%) and non-breast tumors (43%) were blindly tested using a 92-gene cancer classifier (CancerTYPE ID®, Biotheranostics, Inc). Tumor type predictions were reported as rank-order probabilities based on the degree of similarity to the tumor reference database. Assay sensitivity based on concordance of the main tumor type prediction with the reference diagnosis established by clinicopathologic review was analyzed. Results: Assay results included 85 breast carcinomas (TNBC) (53%), 23 Salivary gland carcinomas (14%), and 52 carcinomas (33%) representing 11 other tumor types. For performance in TNBC, the 92-gene assay demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 93% (CI, 86-98), and sensitivities of 96% [95% CI, 89-99] and 80% [95% CI, 52-96], in primary and metastatic tumors, respectively (P=0.085). Additional performance characteristics are shown in Table 1. Conclusions: An optimized 92-gene assay specifically modified to increase performance for the molecular diagnosis of TNBC showed strong accuracy in this blinded study. These findings support use of the 92-gene cancer classifier to aid in the diagnosis of primary or metastatic TNBC. With more refined tumor characterization, TNBC-specific chemotherapy regimens or clinical trial therapies may be pursued with the potential for improved patient outcomes.

Given (noisy and intermittent) sensor readings of the team members' positions in a meeting room, we are interested in inferring the team's current objective.

        "tahun_terbit":1998,
        "abstrak":"Contact tracing or partner noti® cation has as its major objectives: to contribute to the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the population; to identify previously unrecognized cases of infection and through treatment to prevent the development of serious sequelae; and to improve patient management by reducing repeat infections1. Its historical background, role and methods have recently been reviewed2 emphasizing that contact tracing can be most strongly justi® ed in the management of bacterial STDs, where curative treatment is available. The strategies used, personnel involved and methods have been the subject of a large number of studies which were reviewed by Oxman and colleagues3 with the conclusion that there is only weak evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions currently undertaken. Furthermore, even if an intervention is shown to be effective in one setting, it may be unacceptable or ineffective in another population, or not appropriate to the requirements of the day. For example, in Newcastle in 1946 the majority of contact tracing was by provider activity, but this became progressively less appropriate and by 1970 was mainly by patient referral4. All this leaves health advisers (the individuals mostly responsible for partner noti® cation in the UK) with a practical dilemma. They may be practising in a way which seems acceptable to the patients they see and likely to obtain their cooperation, but without a scienti® c evidence base to support their practice, or even to characterize the suitability of their patient population for one intervention rather than another, they cannot provide ® rm justi® cation for what they do. In times of ® nancial stringency, they are potentially the most vulnerable part of the STD control team. The most signi® cant measure for a control strategy must be the prevalence of the STD in the population, but in practice this is very dif® cult to monitor. Herpes simplex serology, which can now differentiate type I and type II infections, provides an index of population prevalence, but as it remains positive inde® nitely the effect of any interventions on behaviour change will not be detectable for many years5. For bacterial STDs, prevalence testing has so far proved impracticable and even with the advent of non-invasive sampling it is likely always to be very costly in effort. The incidence of the complications of gonorrhoea or chlamydia, tubal infertility or acute pelvic in ̄ ammatory disease, is an outcome measure that could be collected systematically, but diagnosed episodes will under-represent the true incidence of events. Even where these measures have been used to show an improvement in control of an STD, as with chlamydia in Sweden6 they can only indicate the end results of many factors including access to treatment, public education, and secular changes in behaviour. Hence a narrower focus on a measurable aspect of contact tracing is necessary. A number of measures have been proposed, some of which have been used in previously reported work (Table 1). The number of partners who attend the clinic in response to partner noti® cation (contact tracing, PN) is a measure that intuitively seems signi® cant, and has been used in the paper presented on pages 657± 660 of this issue. It requires information about partners attending to be fed back to the site where the index diagnosis was made, so is particularly useful in settings where there is a uni® ed STD service with good communications between providers, International Journal of STD & AIDS 1998; 9: 645± 646",

Furthermore, when preventing miR‐155 control of Aicda expression, by genetic mutation of its target site in the Aicda mRNA, IL‐10 could further potentiate Aicda expression. Given that miR‐155 expression is lost, and expression levels of both Aicda and IL‐10 are high in diseases, such as Burkitt’s lymphoma, our results suggest a stringent and sophisticated control of Aicda by a novel IL‐10\/miR‐155 axis, where the imbalance of IL‐10 and\/or miR‐155 may contribute to disease pathogenesis.",

        "tahun_terbit":2014,
        "abstrak":"This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the now legendary case of Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants} A basic sketch of the case is well known. A jury awarded an elderly woman a large sum of money for damages she incurred as a result of spilling hot coffee on herself while seated in her car. Widely reported, the McDonald's case soon reached iconic status in popular culture as the epitome of a \"frivolous lawsuit\" in a society gone amok with hyper-litigiousness. Some commentators have speculated that the case may provide \"more common knowledge about the United States civil justice system than any other single lawsuit.\"2 Indeed, it seems rare to find a student taking a legal studies class who has not encountered the McDonald's hot coffee case prior to class and formed an opinion about it.3The lead author of this pedagogical note has used the McDonald's hot coffee case to teach critical thinking skills in her legal studies classes. Partly because students come to class with preconceived notions about the case, it has proved an excellent vehicle for helping students critically examine their general views about the U.S. tort system. Students leam not only about applicable tort law, but also about how to apply critical thinking skills to legal anecdotes that they leam (or potentially misleam) from the media. Most importantly, by becoming more educated about the facts and law of the hot coffee case the students reflect upon how their misconceptions about the legal system may impede their ability to make effective managerial decisions.The following discussion proceeds in three parts. It begins by describing the development of the hot coffee case study at the University of Maryland University College (UMUC). It then discusses the goals of critical thinking generally. It closes with an assessment of the critical-thinking results achieved at UMUC through the use of the hot coffee case.I. Developing the Case StudyThe MBA Program at UMUC employs an integrated cohort-model that consists of seven seminars worth six-credits each. The hot coffee case was developed for use in the first required seminar. The seminar is offered both online and in a combination online and face-to-face format. The legal environment of business, corporate social responsibility, and business ethics are three of the main topics covered in the seminar.The initial seminar also introduces ten competencies required of high performing managers. These competencies include critical thinking, ethical leadership, systems thinking, decision making, executing decisions, information literacy\/research skills, technology fluency, diversity and crosscultural perspectives, communications skills, and team building skills.4 The MBA program adopts the view that in order to lead effectively, managers must approach their responsibilities from a critical and strategic perspective, while keeping a firm grounding in ethical principles. It also assumes that their success will depend upon the exercise of sound critical thinking skills, which take into account the full ethical and social consequences of their decisions.A. The Hot Coffee AssignmentIn both the online and combination online and face-to-face delivery sections for the course, the students complete the hot coffee assignment online, although in combination delivery sections, the discussion often spills over into the next face-to-face class session. The students perform the assignment in the sixth week of a thirteen-week semester, after they have completed introductory assignments in business ethics and the legal environment of business and after they have analyzed articles using the critical thinking method outlined in Asking the Right Questions: A Guide to Critical Thinking by M. Neil Browne and Stuart M. Keeley.5 The assignment consists of three parts designed for completion in one week.1. Reading the Winnebago Case and Posting Preconceptions about StellaIn the first part of the hot coffee assignment, students read a short newspaper column written under the pseudonym \"The Mighty Quinn\" and post their reactions in an online conference. …",

In humans, fatty acids are a principle energy substrate and structural components of cell membranes (phospholipids) and second messengers. Fatty acids are also ligands of nuclear receptors affecting gene expression. Longer-chain (LC) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid are precursors of lipid mediators such as eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes), resolvins and neuroprotectins. Lipid mediators produced by EPA and DHA (LC n-3 PUFA; mainly found in oily fish) are considered as inflammation-resolving, and thus, fish oil has been characterised as antiinflammatory. Recommendations for EPA plus DHA intake from oily fish vary between 250-450 mg\/day. Dietary reference values for fat vary between nutrition bodies, but mainly agree on a low total and saturated fat intake. The existing literature supports the protective effects of LC n-3 PUFA (as opposed to n-6 PUFA and saturated fat) in maternal and offspring health, cardiovascular health, insulin sensitivity, the metabolic syndrome, cancer, critically ill patients, and immune system disorders.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFatty acids are involved in multiple pathways and play a major role in health. Further investigation and a nutrigenomics approach to the effects of these biocompounds on health and disease development are imperative and highlight the importance of environmental modifications on disease outcome.",

The results led them to conclude that a RAE existed, as relatively older players were over-represented in the NHL drafts. After appraising their contribution, we feel that there are three key points to be reconsidered. These considerations do not disqualify the notion that a RAE exists in NHL draftees; however, they compel one to re-examine study design issues and the interpretation of results.\n\nThe first point for reconsideration concerns the birth quartiles used by the authors. Specifically, Baker and Logan4 divided their sample into quartiles (Q) based on the calendar year for US and Canadian hockey, which is 1 January to 31 December (Q1  =  January to March, Q2  =  April to June, Q3  =  July to September, Q4  =  October to December). The NHL draft calendar, however, runs from 16 September to 15 September. For example, in the 2008 NHL draft, first-year eligible players were born between 16 September 1989 and 15 September 1990. Thus, the relatively oldest players in an NHL draft cohort are born on …",

        "abstrak":"Background In most industrialized societies, regulations, inspections, insurance, and legal options are established to support workers who suffer injury, disease, or death in relation to their work; in practice, these resources are imperfect or even unavailable due to workplace or employer obstruction. Thus, limitations exist to identify unmet needs in occupational safety and health information. Objective The aim of this study was to explore hidden issues related to occupational accidents by examining social network services (SNS) data using topic modeling. Methods Based on the results of a Google search for the phrases occupational accident, industrial accident and occupational diseases, a total of 145 websites were selected. From among these websites, we collected 15,244 documents on queries related to occupational accidents between 2002 and 2018. To transform unstructured text into structure data, natural language processing of the Korean language was conducted. We performed the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as a topic model using a Python library. A time-series linear regression analysis was also conducted to identify yearly trends for the given documents. Results The results of the LDA model showed 14 topics with 3 themes: workers’ compensation benefits (Theme 1), illicit agreements with the employer (Theme 2), and fatal and non-fatal injuries and vulnerable workers (Theme 3). Theme 1 represented the largest cluster (52.2%) of the collected documents and included keywords related to workers’ compensation (ie, company, occupational injury, insurance, accident, approval, and compensation) and keywords describing specific compensation benefits such as medical expense benefits, temporary incapacity benefits, and disability benefits. In the yearly trend, Theme 1 gradually decreased; however, other themes showed an overall increasing pattern. Certain queries (ie, musculoskeletal system, critical care, and foreign workers) showed no significant variation in the number of queries. Conclusions We conducted LDA analysis of SNS data of occupational accident–related queries and discovered that the primary concerns of workers posting about occupational injuries and diseases were workers’ compensation benefits, fatal and non-fatal injuries, vulnerable workers, and illicit agreements with employers. While traditional systems focus mainly on quantitative monitoring of occupational accidents, qualitative aspects formulated by topic modeling from unstructured SNS queries may be valuable to address inequalities and improve occupational health and safety.",

In the 32 y since the introduction of ring-tailed lemurs to the island, two successful depredation events by two different owl species have been documented. We investigated the behavioral response of ring-tailed lemurs to determine if they responded consistently to social calls from all three owl species present on St. Catherines Island despite size differences among the owl species that could affect the likelihood of them serving as predators on ring-tailed lemurs. We observed while ring-tailed lemurs responded to all the auditory owl calls, they exhibited more intense, longer and more consistent responses to the two larger owl species – the barred owl and great horned owl – relative to the small Eastern screech owl. These data suggest naturalized species are capable of learning threat-sensitive antipredator behaviors to novel predator communities.",

Material and methods We performed low-dose CT (LDCT) in asymptomatic individuals ≥50 years old, smokers or former smokers of ≥10 pack-years, with no history of cancer. We followed an evaluation algorithm, according to the size and morphology of the nodules. The appropriate treatment for the LC diagnosis was given and patients were followed up for 5 years. Results We studied 4951 individuals (65.4% males) with an average age of 56.89±5.26 years; 550 presented nodules. Of the 3891 nodules detected, 692 (19.57%) were considered positive, and 38 tumors (36 LC) were identified. In the annual follow-up, nodules were found in 224 subjects, 288 (7.91%) of which were positive (13 LC). In 80%, the study was performed with LDCT, and biopsy was indicated in 5.8% (baseline) and in 7.6% (annual) of the positive nodules. Prevalence was 0.89 and incidence was 0.1%. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV in the baseline study were 92.31, 89.54, 6.55 and 99.93%, respectively, and in the annual study, they were 76.92, 95.7, 4.52 and 99.94%, respectively. A total of 52 tumors were detected (49 LC), 25 (52.08%) in stage I. The 5-year overall survival rate for LC was 58.5% and cancer-specific survival was 67.1% (75.8% in surgical patients).

        "abstrak":": The goal of surgical stabilization of the unstable glenohumeral joint is to produce a stable yet mobile joint that can return to preinjury function. Open surgical procedures (in particular, the Bankart procedure) have evolved to a point where stability and mobility are being attained with a low complication rate, but the rate of return to preinjury function, particularly in overhead athletes, has not been ideal. Arthroscopic stabilization is an attractive alternative to open procedures, particularly in those patients who have a history of traumatic and unidirectional recurrent dislocations with a labral detachment. A variety of techniques for reattaching a detached labro-ligamentous complex have been described. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the efficacy of these procedures fully, particularly in light of the good results now being obtained with the open Bankart procedure. Longer-term studies have shown a higher rate of recurrence of dislocation with the arthroscopic technique than with the open technique. Arthroscopic stabilization offers the potential advantages of shorter hospitalization, less traumatic treatment of the soft tissues, more thorough examination of the glenohumeral joint and subacromial bursa, and greater cosmesis. It could also provide a means by which selective stabilization of those initial anterior dislocations that might be prone to recurrence could be performed. Long-term follow-up and randomized studies comparing open and arthroscopic techniques are needed to further define the best role of arthroscopic shoulder stabilization and to determine which of the several techniques described provides the best results with the fewest complications.",

        "abstrak":"Index funds and indexed ETFs managed by the “Big Three” – BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street – have grown to be the largest investors in the capital markets and have become the presumptive “deciders” of corporate law controversies. With this prominence has come controversy. Commentators have bemoaned their lack of financial incentives to ensure that the companies in their portfolios are well run and have suggested that index funds should not be allowed to vote the shares of the companies in their portfolio or should be subjected to special regulations. \n \nIn this article, we provide a systematic and differentiated analysis of the incentive and information structure within which advisers to index funds operate. Overall, the Big Three have among the strongest direct financial incentives to become informed. These incentives derive from their enormous scale and scope. This is important in several ways. First, scale increases the likelihood that their decisions will be pivotal. Second, even at a low percentage fee, their share of increases in firm value will be larger than almost any other shareholder. Third, they benefit from economies of scope in setting market wide governance standards. Fourth, the scale generates reputational incentives to be seen as responsible stewards, both for marketing and to forestall regulation. On the other hand, unlike advisers to active funds, advisers to index funds do not have indirect, flow-based incentives and have lesser access to company-specific information generated by analysts in the context of their investment activities. \n \nThe differences between advisers to active and advisers to index funds have different implications for the three core areas of engagement: high profile proxy contests between activist shareholders and boards; broad market wide governance standards; and monitoring of portfolio company governance and performance. With regard to the highest profile contests that will likely affect firm value, the strong direct incentives should assure that the Big Three will vote intelligently. With regard to market wide governance standards, the Big Three are better positioned than any other shareholders to set the standards: they enjoy economies of scope and analysts-generated information is generally not important. With regard to company specific monitoring of governance, the Big Three are similarly well positioned. By contrast, with regard to company specific performance – for which analyst-generated information tends to be important – hedge funds and advisers to large actively managed funds will often be in a better position to become engaged than advisers to index funds. On the whole, our corporate governance world would be poorer if index funds could not vote their shares and proposals singling out index funds for regulation are unwarranted.",

The parallel version presented in the chapter comprises of three main parts: the momentum equation solver, the Possion solver, and particle movement. The momentum equation solver is based on explicit finite difference discretization of the original equations in primitive variables, the Possion solver is based on 5-point finite difference (FD) discretization of Possion's equation, and the particles generated at the inlets move according to the velocity field calculated in the two previous steps. The parallelization is performed by splitting the computation domain into a number of vertical strips and assigning each of these to one processor.

The results show the formation of a large number of structures along and upstream of the quasi-parallel bow shock. Their outer edges exhibit density and magnetic field enhancements, while their cores exhibit drops in density, magnetic field, solar wind velocity, and enhancements in ion temperature. Using virtual spacecraft in the simulation, we show that the signatures of these structures in the time series data are very similar to those of SHFAs seen in THEMIS data and conclude that they correspond to SHFAs. Examination of the simulation data shows that SHFAs form as the result of foreshock cavitons interacting with the bow shock. Foreshock cavitons in turn form due to the nonlinear evolution of ULF waves generated by the interaction of the solar wind with the backstreaming ions. Because foreshock cavitons are an inherent part of the shock dissipation process, the formation of SHFAs is also an inherent part of the dissipation process leading to a highly nonuniform plasma in the quasi-parallel magnetosheath including large-scale density and magnetic field cavities.",

Primary data were obtained through the measurement of solid waste generated in the selected private health institutions segregated into sharps, plastic and nylon, paper, food waste, pharmaceutical, pathological components. PHI in each LGAs of Ibadan metropolis were stratified according to the services they render. Simple random sampling technique was used to select one PHI from each stratum for data collection. Waste components categorized as ‘others’ was the highest waste generated (10.68kg). This accounted for 23.6% of the total waste generated and a daily average of 0.51kg. The per capita waste generation was 0.01kg\/head\/day. The lowest waste component (0.38kg) generated was pharmaceutical waste and it represented 0.84% of the total waste generated. The daily average for this waste component was 0.02kg. The per capita generation of sharp waste components was 0.01kg\/head\/day. Food waste represented 19.2% of the total waste generated while nylon\/plastic represented 18.4%. The study concluded that a better understanding of the composition of medical solid waste is fundamental in order to choose the best management approach sequel to generation. This study has shown that very little has been done on medical waste management in the study area. Thus, this study recommends that; the stakeholders (the state ministries of Environment and Health and the Oyo State Waste Management Agency) should pursue strict enforcement of legislation that will have a significant impact on the sorting, segregation and storage of medical solid waste in the study area.",

The amplitude of the phasic task-evoked pupillary response reflected these changes in performance, decreasing significantly over time on the task.

If these tools can be integrated for design optimization, it will undoubtedly enhance a manufacturer's competitiveness. Such integration, however, faces three main challenges: (1) high computational expense of simulation, (2) the simulation process being a black-box function, and (3) design problems being high dimensional. In the past two decades, metamodeling has been intensively developed to deal with expensive black-box functions, and has achieved success for low dimensional design problems. But when high dimensionality is also present in design, which is often found in practice, there lacks of a practical method to deal with the so-called high dimensional, expensive, and black-box (HEB) problems. This paper proposes the first metamodel of its kind to tackle the HEB problem. This paper integrates the radial basis function with high dimensional model representation into a new model, RBF-HDMR. The developed RBF-HDMR model offers an explicit function expression, and can reveal (1 ) the contribution of each design variable, (2) inherent linearity\/nonlinearity with respect to input variables, and (3) correlation relationships among input variables. An accompanying algorithm to construct the RBF - HDMR has also been developed. The model and the algorithm fundamentally change the exponentially growing computation cost to be polynomial. Testing and comparison confirm the efficiency and capability of RBF-HDMR for HEB problems.",

        "abstrak":"The mathematical ABSTRACT The mathematical solution for the true positions of features in space from the position of their images on pairs of radiographs has been discussed in Ballistic Research Labora­ tory reports by Grabarek and Herr (BRL TN 1634, September 1966, AD 807619), and by Henry C. Dubin (BRL MR 2470, April 1975, AD B003797L, now available for unlimited distribu­ tion). A truly general solution should not require, or be limited to, orthogonality of the image pairs. Dubin provides such a solution. Because of errors in setup and measure­ ment, the two lines presumed to connect the respective source and image points through the common object point do not necessarily intersect. Using vector notation and partial deriv­ atives, he obtains the line of minimum length between these two vectors. The midpoint of this line is the best estimate for the object position, and the length is a measure of the error of the estimate. The redundant image coordinate in Dubin1s method contributes to increasing the accuracy of the estimate of the position of features. The solution of Gra­ barek and Herr uses analytic geometry and the assumption that the two lines between the respective sources and images intersect, and requires an orthogonal radiographic setup. This approach forgoes generality and some available accuracy. Driven by the need to provide as simple an approach as possible, this paper presents two similar derivations. The author uses analytic geometry to re-derive the equations of Grabarek and Herr from a simpler perspective. The form of the solution provides a concep­ tual bridge to a more direct derivation by the author, using trigonometry. Both deriva­ tions are for orthogonal radiographic setups. The trigonometric approach does not require complicated computation of magnification factors, is more easily understood in terms of the geometry of the setup, and is easily implemented in computer or calculator programs to reduce orthogonal radiographs. Flash radiography is a specialized technique widely used in ballistic experimentation to produce stop-motion images of extremely fast events. A small x-ray source of brief duration produces a stereographic projection of intervening objects to form a shadowgraph on a recording medium. The source luminosity and frequency spectrum are tailored to produce a shadowgraph of usable image quality. When geometric information is desired, the source and image positions are carefully controlled. Timing, too, is carefully control­ led, if kinematic information is sought. The true position of an object must be calcula­ ted from the measurements of its image on film, and from the known positions of sources and film. The goal of this paper is to make the mathematical basis of the data reduction understandable to as many people involved in the process as possible. This paper presents two new means of deriving the reduction equations in common use. One approach is based on analytic geometry, but takes a more straightforward approach than in past works. The second approach is to attack the problem from a simpler perspective, using trigonometry. The resulting trigonometric formulae are mathematically equivalent to those currently used. However, the form in which they are presented is quite simple, making implementa­ tion easy. I hope that by making several different approaches available, this paper will be helpful to those having to learn the subject. 2. BACKGROUND To those with a good background in mathematics, there already exists a very simple and elegant approach to the reduction of flash x-rays, but one which is apparently not in wide use. The procedure has the added advantage of being extremely general. It is given in a Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) paper by Henry C. Dubin . In Dubin's method, the pair of tube heads which are flashed simultaneously may be located anywhere, as long as the coordinates of their source points are known. For any feature recorded in any pair of non-parallel shadowgraphs, there are two sets of two orthogonal measurements of position that can be made, but only three independent spatial coordinates to be determined. Dubin's procedure utilizes this redundancy to improve on the accuracy of the estimate of the features1 positions. The equations for two lines are found, one from each source to its respective image point. Due to uncertainties in setup and measurement, these lines do not",

Although the vacuum cannot provide the “missing mass” required to close the universe today, its presence earlier in the history of the universe could have important consequences. Element abundances from primordial nucleosynthesis require the ratio x = ϱ vac \/( ϱ vac + ϱ rad ) ⩽ 0.1 of neutrino (or equivalent light) species to exceed N ν > 4, a case ruled out in the standard cosmological model. If the vacuum decays into low energy photons, the lack of observed spectral distortions in the microwave background gives tighter bounds, x −4 .

        "tahun_terbit":2013,
        "abstrak":"Two coal utility plants in South Africa selected (one from Sasol and another from Eskom) for this study produce large volumes of fly ash (over 40 Mt from Eskom at Tutuka, and 3 Mt from Sasol Synfuels at Secunda annually), and brines as by-products during coal processing. Co-disposal of the brines and fly ashes has been a normal practice in these coal-utility plants for decades. Long-term management of fly ash is necessary and requires an understanding and knowledge of how the different waste materials interact with water and brines in different chemical situations. However the geochemistry of their interactions, the leaching and mobility of elements in these disposal systems has not been fully understood. This work gives insights into the chemical processes taking place in the brine-water\/brines systems that govern the concentrations of major and minor elements in ash leachates under different environmental conditions. The possible presence of organic compounds (subsequently referred to as 'organics') in brines and their effects on the leaching chemistry of fly ash was also studied. Sustainability and long term impact of the co-disposal of fly ash and brines on the environment was studied through static (batch tests) modeling of the pH-dependent acid neutralization capacity (ANC) tests and columns modeling for dynamic leach tests. The modeling was based on experimental results from other Sasol-Eskom ashbrine project collaborators. Modeling results of the ANC tests were in good agreement with the reported experimental results, which revealed that the release trends of various elements (including trace, heavy elements and contaminants) contained in fly ash into solution is highly pH dependent. However Na, K, Mo and Li exhibited constant solubilisation which was independent of pH changes from all the scenarios. The presence of different constituents of brines subjected to ANC resulted to different ANC capacities ranging from 0.98 moles H⁺\/Kg dry ash (of ash-organics mixed with Mg-brines) to 3.87 H⁺\/Kg dry ash for those with the C(4) brines. As expected, those constituents from the cationic brines were found on the lower region of acid addition (in the order Mg-brines < Ca-brines < Na-brines) while the anionic brines were found at the upper region of acid addition (in the order S(6)-brines < Cl-brines < C(4)-brines). In the middle region of acid addition were three important scenarios: that of ash with brine, ash without brines (i.e. ash with DMW) and ash with both ASW organics and combined brines. It was from these three scenarios that a generalization of the effect of brines and organics on the ANC was inferred. The ANC of ash with demineralised water (DMW) was 2.33 mol H⁺\/Kg dry ash and that of ash with ASW organics lower at 2.12 mol H⁺\/Kg dry ash which was the same value as that of ash with combined brines. This indicated that brines decreased the ANC of ash by about 9.01 % and which could be attributed to the acid-base neutralization process and the dynamics of solid phase dissolutions in response to the acid…",

Thus, affect may play a critical role in allowing the learning, or bootstrapping of abstract knowledge. Of course it is the case that not all abstract words are affectively loaded. Affect, nonetheless, could have an important role in allowing for knowledge that cannot be grounded to the external world to begin developing. Once the system is set in place, other abstract concepts can be learned based on linguistic information only. (Meteyard et al. 2012: 800) We will pay a little bit more attention to phylogeny, taking as a point of departure the discussion in Jablonka et al. (2012). For hominids, the whole body, including positioning in relation to others (proxemics), was available for communication. The signals were strongly emotive and at the same time strongly context-bound (iconic and deictic). Jablonka et al. point out that early humans distinguished themselves from the other hominids through strong inner group interaction, in which cooperation was important (see Tomasello and Vaish 2013: 237f), for example in the form of alloparenting (taking care of each other’s offspring). This required control of emotions, in particular the suppression of aggression. In other words, self-domestication was a useful evolutionary step. This context was favorable for the development of communicative tools which were free from too much emotional involvement. Every small venture in that direction was awarded by evolutionary forces, first as a social practice, then co-evolutionary incorporated in the genes, because individuals who were good at this type of signals (“symbols”) had an advantage. An important part of self-domestication has to do with the control of emotions. With the help of a non-emotional communicative instrument, communication can take place in a more neutral, objective way than with body language; see Jablonka et al. (2012: 2157):",

In order to clarify the nature of the list, it is necessary to explain something further about both the time period it covers and the nature of the items included. In the main, the list cites reports, papers, theses, and dissertations submitted to meet the partial requirements of Master's and doctoral degrees awarded since July 1, 1964. The reporting system and the publication schedule, however, combine to introduce into the list some theses submitted for degrees awarded before that time. The supplying of information for this list has been left largely to the schools with theses to report. Each time that publication is impending, a notice is sent to all the library schools accredited by the American Library Association and to those other schools that have been represented in previous listings. Thus, schools that have not previously reported lack the benefit of the notice and may submit lists that have to be held over for the next publication. Our press schedule requires manuscripts to be ready three months in advance of publication, and any school that wishes to be included in the list has to submit its report somewhat prior to the copy deadline. Another factor in the publication schedule concerns the time of the year when the list appears. This has to vary because of other committments of the Library Quarterly. The widespread interest shown in these reports caused us to promise in October, 1964, that the October issue each year would regularly carry the list. However, the length of the proceedings of the thirtieth Annual Conference of the Graduate Library School, \"Area Studies and the Library,\" appearing in the October, 1965, issue made publication of the list of theses unfeasible at that time. Consequently, in response to reminders of publication, some theses were reported for degrees awarded after the conclusion of the academic year 1964-65. (Some theses have been reported' for 1966 because the degrees for which they were submitted will not be awarded before 1966.) These variations in the time of reporting and publishing make it difficult to compare the lists published in different years. This list has previously been entitled \"Graduate Theses Accepted by Library Schools in the United States and Canada.\" It has always included doctoral theses that many prefer to call dissertations. During the past few years some schools have also reported reports of special projects and internships and papers representing a survey of the literature as well as theses submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master's degree.

The aim of this study was to investigate how women understand and experience their maternity care and to report which aspects of care women highlight as most important.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis large qualitative study explored women's expectations and experiences of maternity care provision. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 53 women experiencing maternity care in a range of tertiary, regional, rural, remote hospitals and midwife-led practices in the state of New South Wales, Australia during 2011-2012. Included in the interview schedule was the question 'What 3 aspects would you see as most important for delivery of maternity care?' Descriptive analyses of entire transcripts and responses to the question on most important aspects of care were undertaken.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDescriptive analyses of women's responses identified 5 important aspects of care: woman-focused care, staff qualities, systems and facilities, family-focused care and continuity of care\/information. First-time mothers were more likely to identify woman-focused care, staff qualities and continuity of care\/information as important aspects than multiparous mothers. Urban and regional mothers highlighted staff qualities as having greater importance for satisfaction with their care while rural and particularly remote women nominated systems and facilities as important.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study showed that women from a range of settings are more concerned with staff and relational issues than facilities. Differences in perceptions among primiparous versus multiparous women, at different stages of pregnancy and among women from rural and remote compared to urban settings highlight the need to include women with a diversity of experience when trying to understand the aspects of maternity care most important to women.",

Variables from sleep studies included the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), titration pressure, and CPAP use (hours per night) after 3 months. Median MCSA was used to categorize subjects into small and large MCSA groups. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between results of polysomnography and nasal acoustic reflection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt baseline the small and large MCSA groups were not different (P > .05) in BMI, age, mask type, or previous nasal stuffiness, but there were more women in the smaller MCSA group (P = .02). CPAP use was significantly lower in the small MCSA group (P = .007), but apnea-hypopnea index and titration pressure were indistinguishable between the 2 groups. Furthermore, CPAP use correlated significantly and positively with MCSA (r = 0.34, P = .008), mean area (r = 0.27, P = .04), and volume (r = 0.28, P = .03). Step-wise multiple regression models revealed that MCSA was a predictor of the CPAP compliance (R2 = 0.16, P = .002), and MCSA (P = .001) and age (P = .04) were predictive factors of CPAP compliance (R2= 0.22). Nasal dimensions were not related to subjective nasal stuffiness.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCPAP use in patients with smaller nasal passages was lower than in those with larger passages. Objective measurement of nasal dimension may be more reliable than subjective self-report of nasal symptoms in identifying patients with OSAHS who might struggle with CPAP therapy.",

Instead of the temperature decrement at each subchain, it decides the decrement ratio at the start of each Markov chain using the standard deviation of the cost distribution in the previous Markov chain of the full length. Thus the improved annealing schedule keeps a good temperature profile even with a large number of processors. We also enhance the communication pattern. \n \nThe new parallel annealing algorithm has a simple communication pattern and thus less communication overheads. The decomposition strategy of this parallel annealing algorithm is independent of application problems. Experimental results of the step-wise-overlapped parallel annealing algorthm for the travelling salesman problems show high efficiencies even when a large number of processors are used; it produces near optimal solutions with a speedup of 70.8 by using 128 processors.

As a consequence, issues of participation, responsiveness and relevance are fundamental to the health and vitality of planning systems. To accurately diagnose this aspect of the patient's condition it is necessary, as Allmendinger notes, to examine `the rich context in which planning operates' (2002: 4). This article does so by shedding light on planning consultation at the local level. It examines the often overlooked relationships between community councils (the lowest level of statutory community representation in planning) and principal councils (a term employed to include all local authorities and national parks that make planning decisions). The article will illustrate the frequency, function and degree of agreement existing between different council tiers on planning deliberations and, from this, identify a number of crucial points of tension between community councils and the planning system. These tensions centre on the nature of democracy within the system, the legitimacy of local knowledge in deliberation, and perhaps most importantly, the (perceived) interests and values of the planning system as they are practised. The article will argue that these tensions produce both competence and confidence disparities between councils and, as a consequence, the planning dialogue is reduced to each council `talking to the hand' of the other. Such circumstances raise important concerns regarding the vitality of the planning system in remaining relevant and responsive to these local participants, and thus the health of the planning system overall.",

Specifically, we look at the changing public perceptions of newly medicalized disorders with accompanying newly medicalized terms (e.g. impotence has become erectile dysfunction disorder). Does using “medicalese” to label a recently medicalized disorder lead to a change in the perception of that condition? Undergraduate students (n = 52) rated either the medical or lay label for recently medicalized disorders (such as erectile dysfunction disorder vs. impotence) and established medical conditions (such as a myocardial infarction vs. heart attack) for their perceived seriousness, disease representativeness and prevalence. Students considered the medical label of the recently medicalized disease to be more serious (mean = 4.95 (SE = .27) vs. mean = 3.77 (SE = .24) on a ten point scale), more representative of a disease (mean = 2.47 (SE = .09) vs. mean = 1.83 (SE = .09) on a four point scale), and have lower prevalence (mean = 68 (SE = 12.6) vs. mean = 122 (SE = 18.1) out of 1,000) than the same disease described using common language. A similar pattern was not seen in the established medical conditions, even when controlled for severity. This study demonstrates that the use of medical language in communication can induce bias in perception; a simple switch in terminology results in a disease being perceived as more serious, more likely to be a disease, and more likely to be a rare condition. These findings regarding the conceptualization of disease have implications for many areas, including medical communication with the public, advertising, and public policy.",

        "abstrak":"sight of the financial industry, it is perhaps valuable to remind ourselves of the difficulty of protecting investors from all forms of fraud and market manipulation.This issue begins with an article related to the ability to provide proper insight into hedge fund operations. In “Madoff:A Returns-Based Analysis,” Thomas Schneeweis and Edward Szado raise a fundamental question:Were there any reasonable means by which the typical investor and\/or consultants could have determined that the various investment vehicles by which investors accessed Madoff were not in fact offering what they claimed? While a detailed due diligence analysis of the Madoff infrastructure that included various feeder funds as well as Madoff ’s auditing, custodial, and prime brokerage relationships may well have dissuaded investors or their consultants from investing in Madoff, most individual investors have neither the financial resources nor the skill to conduct such an analysis.This article examines a number of empirical characteristics derived from return streams of several Madoff feeder funds whose return data were available in various databases. Results show that potential problems were evident in the footprint of the returns, but unfortunately those footprints were well hidden. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds are reluctant to provide detailed information on their investment portfolios. However, incomplete disclosure can have some undesirable side effects. In the second article, “Hedge Fund Transparency:Where Do We Stand?”Felix Goltz and David Schröder present the results of a comprehensive survey of hedge fund managers and investors on current hedge fund reporting practices. In analyzing the spectrum of opinions, the authors identify critical points of conflict between investors and product providers. They find that investors are especially dissatisfied with the quality of information on liquidity and operational risk exposure. The ability to understand the fundamental properties of various investment strategies lies at the heart of investing in various alternative assets. Academic and practitioner research has presented strong evidence in support of the addition of commodity futures contracts to a diversified stock portfolio to lower the risk of the overall rate of return. In the third article, “Stock Market and Agricultural Futures Diversification: An International Perspective,” Kamal Smimou augments the potential for diversification by considering the use of foreign agricultural futures contracts. In the fourth article “Exit Strategies of Buyout Investments: An Empirical Analysis,” Daniel Schmidt, Sascha Steffen, and Franziska Szabó examine a different type of alternative investment. Although buyout investments represent a considerable proportion of private equity volume, little research has been done on the exit strategies of buyout THOMAS SCHNEEWEIS Editor HOSSEIN KAZEMI Associate Editor NOEL AMENC Associate Editor BHASWAR GUPTA Assistant Editor",

        "tahun_terbit":2006,
        "abstrak":"Driven by high growth rates of internet traffic the question of upgrading existing optical metro-, regio- and long haul transport networks introducing 40 Gbit\/s\/λ is one of the most important questions today and in the near future. Current WDM Systems in photonic networks are commonly operated at linerates of 2.5 and 10 Gbit\/s\/λ. Induced by market analyses and the historical development of transport systems some work has already been carried out to evaluate update scenarios from 10 to 40 Gbit\/s channel data rates. Due to the inherent quadruplication of the bandwidth per channel, limitations due to linear and non-linear transmission impairments become stronger resulting in a highly increased complexity of link engineering, potentially increasing the capital and operational expenditures. A lot of work is therefore in progress, which targets at the relaxation of constraints for 40 Gbit\/s transmission to find the most efficient upgrade strategies. One approach towards an increased robustness against signal distortions is the introduction of more advanced modulation formats. Different modulation schemes show strongly different optical WDM transmission characteristics. The choice of the appropriate format does not only depend on the technical requirements, but also on economical considerations as an increased transmitter- and receiver-complexity will drive the transponder price. This article presents investigations on different modulation formats for the upgrade of existing metro-\/ regio and long haul transport networks. Tolerances and robustness against the main degrading effects dispersion, noise and nonlinearities are considered together with mitigation strategies like the adaptation of dispersion maps. Results from numerical simulations are provided for some of the most promising modulation formats like NRZ, RZ, CS-RZ, Optical Duobinary and DPSK.",

        "abstrak":"Early allergic sensitisation (atopy) is the first step in the development of allergic diseases such as atopic asthma later in life. Genes and pathways associated with atopy and atopic asthma in children and adolescents have not been well characterised. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of atopy and atopic asthma in white blood cells (WBCs) or whole blood was conducted in a cohort of 460 Puerto Ricans aged 9–20 years (EVA-PR study) and in a cohort of 250 Swedish adolescents (BAMSE study). Pathway enrichment and network analyses were conducted to further assess top findings, and classification models of atopy and atopic asthma were built using expression levels for the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In a meta-analysis of the study cohorts, both previously implicated genes (e.g. IL5RA and IL1RL1) and genes not previously reported in TWASs (novel) were significantly associated with atopy and\/or atopic asthma. Top novel genes for atopy included SIGLEC8 (p=8.07×10−13), SLC29A1 (p=7.07×10−12) and SMPD3 (p=1.48×10−11). Expression quantitative trait locus analyses identified multiple asthma-relevant genotype–expression pairs, such as rs2255888\/ALOX15. Pathway enrichment analysis uncovered 16 significantly enriched pathways at adjusted p<0.01, including those relevant to T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) and Th2 immune responses. Classification models built using the top DEGs and a few demographic\/parental history variables accurately differentiated subjects with atopic asthma from nonatopic control subjects (area under the curve 0.84). We have identified genes and pathways for atopy and atopic asthma in children and adolescents, using transcriptome-wide data from WBCs and whole blood samples. In Puerto Rican and Swedish children, a TWAS identified 59 DEGs by atopy and 40 DEGs by atopic asthma, including SIGLEC8 and IL17RB. Transcriptomic data from WBCs could be used to develop predictive models of atopy\/atopic asthma in prospective studies. http:\/\/ow.ly\/kF6v30nYnYC",

MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study was prospective and descriptive in nature and was carried out over the course of three years in an urban Health District in Toledo, Spain. Information recorded included height and weight, tobacco use, previous consumption of oral contraceptives, and numbers of pregnancies and abortions prior to the current gestation. Levels of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), free Thyroxin (FT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) were determined during the first trimester and 3 and 6 months postpartum. A urine sample was collected for determination of iodine levels. Thyroid ultrasonography was performed on all pregnant subjects concurrently with analytical sample collection at 3 months of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum. RESULTS: The sample contained 157 pregnant women, of whom 25 (15.9%) developed PPT. Of these, 44.0% were positive for TPO antibodies in the first trimester, compared to 4.5% of the subjects who did not develop PPT (P<.001). At the end of the first year, 5 (20%) were still afflicted with hypothyroidism. The complete study group of pregnant women displayed a median urinary iodine level of 135 microg\/L. A minor BMI was found in the PPT subjects when compared with the rest of the study group (21.7 vs 24.5; P=.000). A greater frequency of PPT was found in Rh-negative women (33.3 vs 12.2%; P=.015). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PPT exceeded that previously reported. We have only found a significant correlation between PPT and BMI and Rh factor. Based on the high incidence rate detected in our Health District, an active search for cases of PPT might be justified.",

In the paper, the use of a linear phase FIR digital low-pass filter with finite wordlength precision coefficients is proposed, designed using the compensation procedure, to minimise EMG artefacts in contaminated EEG signals. To make the filtering more effective, different structures are used, i.e. cascading, twicing and sharpening (apart from simple low-pass filtering) of the designed FIR filter. Modifications are proposed to twicing and sharpening structures to regain the linear phase characteristics that are lost in conventional twicing and sharpening operations. The efficacy of all these transformed filters in minimising EMG artefacts is studied, using SNR improvements as a performance measure for simulated signals. Time plots of the signals are also compared. Studies show that the modified sharpening structure is superior in performance to all other proposed methods. These algorithms have also been applied to real or recorded EMG-contaminated EEG signal. Comparison of time plots, and also the output SNR, show that the proposed modified sharpened structure works better in minimising EMG artefacts compared with other methods considered.",

Nevertheless, neither the evolution of church-state relations during the long period of the Salazar dictatorship nor the heterogeneity of views and actions of the Catholic hierarchy have been taken into account. The study of the educational reports of the Diocese of Beira (1950-1973) supports not only the overall weakness of the results but also the administrative authority’s derelictions of duty. The government only assumed their responsibilities to the imminence of war, against the interest and the almost exclusive role of religious education agents in expanding and improving the indigenous school network. The commitment of a significant part of the clergy of the central region of Mozambique to an unfair social reality which was contrary to the Gospel, led to educational and pastoral options whose result was the political awareness of indigenous elites who had been educated by the church.

        "abstrak":"Smooth random Gaussian functions play an important role in mathematical physics, a main example being the random plane wave model conjectured by Berry to give a universal description of high-energy eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on generic compact manifolds. Our work is motivated by questions about the geometry of such random functions, in particular relating to the structure of their nodal and level sets. We study four discretisation schemes that extract information about level sets of planar Gaussian fields. Each scheme recovers information up to a different level of precision, and each requires a maximum mesh-size in order to be valid with high probability. The first two schemes are generalisations and enhancements of similar schemes that have appeared in the literature (Beffara and Gayet in Publ Math IHES, 2017. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10240-017-0093-0; Mischaikow and Wanner in Ann Appl Probab 17:980–1018, 2007); these give complete topological information about the level sets on either a local or global scale. As an application, we improve the results in Beffara and Gayet (2017) on Russo–Seymour–Welsh estimates for the nodal set of positively-correlated planar Gaussian fields. The third and fourth schemes are, to the best of our knowledge, completely new. The third scheme is specific to the nodal set of the random plane wave, and provides global topological information about the nodal set up to ‘visible ambiguities’. The fourth scheme gives a way to approximate the mean number of excursion domains of planar Gaussian fields.",

The dietary factors found significantly linked to lower odds of CAS were use of vitamin A supplement [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.06–1.33, P = 0.003], consumption of vitamin A rich fruit and vegetables (AOR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.04–1.27, P = 0.006), meat (AOR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.17–2.05, P = 0.002), legumes (AOR = 1.38, 95%CI = 1.05–1.81, P = 0.021), and meal frequency > 3 (AOR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.04–1.37, P = 0.020). The non-dietary household and child factors found significantly linked to higher odds of CAS were rural residence (AOR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.18–1.41, P < 0.001), low household wealth (AOR = 1.91, 95%CI = 1.53–2.39, P < 0.001), low caregivers’ education level (AOR = 2.14, 95%CI = 1.33–3.44, P < 0.001), male sex (AOR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.04–1.50, P = 0.015), age 12–23 months (AOR = 1.65, 95%CI = 1.57–1.73, P < 0.001), history of infection (AOR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.00–1.30, P = 0.048), and small birth size (AOR = 1.99, 95%CI = 1.58–2.51, P < 0.001).ConclusionAmong infants and young children in Ethiopia, there was a concerning high level of CAS, which was associated with various dietary and non-dietary factors. Enhanced public health\/nutrition interventions, with due emphasis on the multifactorial nature of CAS, might stand an important consideration to reduce the burden of CAS in Ethiopia and beyond.",

The goal is to evaluate which generators must stop production to be checked periodically for safety reasons. Preventive maintenance is crucial because a failure in a power plant may cause a general breakdown in an electric grid. This situation might result in a disruption of electric service to customers. The objective is to perform the problem of PPPMS from a reliability perspective, so the reliability of the system is maximized. The model presented considers the integration of wind power plants or wind farms into a traditional electric generating system comprising thermal, hydroelectric, and nuclear power units. The resulting model is categorized as an optimization problem. A case study based on a real power system is presented. Its main objective is to validate the efficiency of the proposed analysis.",

The ontogeny of rat Pgp\/MDR1 is still doubtful, and such knowledge may be helpful in understanding age-related pharmacokinetics. The purpose of this study was to determine, whether Pgp\/MDR1 expression is altered during development. METHODS: Postnatal expression of Pgp was determined using immunohistochemical method. Tissue from Wistar rat were isolated on the 1st day (D1), 7th day (D7), 14th day (D14), 21st day of life (D21) and from adult animals (60 days old; Ad). RESULTS: Our ontogeny study illustrated that expression of Pgp was relatively constant from birth to adulthood.

The National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies (NCAN) and Helen Hayes Hospital are studying long-term independent home use of P300-based BCIs by people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This BCI use takes place without technical oversight, and users can encounter substantial variation in their day-to-day BCI performance. The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate features in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that correlate with successful BCI performance during home use with the goal of improving BCI for people with neuromuscular disorders.\n\n\nAPPROACH\nNine people with ALS used a P300-based BCI at home over several months for communication and computer control. Sessions from a routine calibration task were categorized as successful (≥70%) or unsuccessful (<70%) BCI performance. The correlation of temporal and spectral EEG features with BCI performance was then evaluated.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nBCI performance was positively correlated with an increase in alpha-band (8-14 Hz) activity at locations PO8, P3, Pz, and P4; and beta-band (15-30 Hz) activity at occipital locations. In addition, performance was significantly positively correlated with a positive deflection in EEG amplitude around 220 ms at frontal mid-line locations (i.e., Fz and Cz). BCI performance was negatively correlated with delta-band (1-3 Hz) activity recorded from occipital locations.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nThese results highlight the variability found in the EEG and describe EEG features that correlate with successful BCI performance during day-to-day use of a P300-based BCI by people with ALS. These results should inform studies focused on improved BCI reliability for people with neuromuscular disorders.",

The neck is modeled using discrete elements and the head model is three-dimensional. In the study presented here, a viscoelastic foundation (i.e., foundation defined by both springs and dampers) concept is introduced to simulate the head-neck boundary conditions during the impact load to the head. Time histories of the brain response in finite element head models with a viscoelastic neck are compared with the corresponding solutions of finite element head models with an elastic neck, and without a neck. It is observed that the magnitude of peaks in the brain's response time histories, at a later stage (i.e., 6 to 15 ms) of the simulation, decreases when dampers are induced to the elastic neck. A parametric study is also conducted to examine the brain response while varying different damping coefficient values for the neck. The magnitude of peaks in the brain's response time histories for models with different neck damping coefficients is observed to maintain some form of proportionality. In other words, the magnitude of peaks in the brain's response time histories decreases with an increased damping coefficient of the neck at the later stage of the simulation (i.e., 6 to 15 ms). From the outcomes of this study, it can be determined that the head-neck boundary conditions during head impact loading are important for studying the brain's response at the later stages of the head impact.",

Early years in medical school, practical experience, and psychology studies, succeeded by theses and examinations, were all directed to successfully gain adequate knowledge\/skills to become a well-trained CAP clinician. Specialist residencies followed, in CAP\/psychosomatics, paediatrics and adult psychiatry. In parallel to broad clinical responsibilities, soon, first research activities, successful grant applications, and intensive collaborations with publicly funded research consortia were strongly stimulated, to start an academic career. Clinical research in CAP areas of, e.g., psychoendocrinology\/intersexuality, psychophysiology, psychopharmacology, migrant psychiatry, coping and compliance in somatic disease were pursued, including a 2-year research assignment abroad (USA). Unexpectedly, back in Germany, the author joined clinical CNS research in an international pharmaceutical company for several years, finally focussing on studies in juveniles.

        "abstrak":"Abstract Encarsia bimaculata was recently described from India as a potentially useful parasitoid of Bemisia tabaci. Its developmental biology was studied in the laboratory at 25–30 °C and 70–75% RH. Results showed that E. bimaculata is a solitary, arrhenotokous, heteronomous, autoparasitoid. Mated females laid eggs internally in B. tabaci nymphs that developed as primary parasitoids. Males developed as hyperparasitoids, either in females of their own species or in other primary aphelinid parasitoids. Superparasitism was common under cage conditions. Both sexes have an egg, three larval instars, prepupal, and pupal stages. Development from egg to adult took 12.70 ± 2.10 days for females and 14.48 ± 2.60 days for males. Individual B. tabaci nymphs were examined for E. bimaculata parasitization using three isozymes: esterase, malate dehydrogenase, and xanthine dehydrogenase. All three isozymes showed differential banding patterns that identified E. bimaculata parasitized or unparasitized B. tabaci nymphs.",

To achieve dynamic bandwidth allocation for the two QoS classes in the RPR, each node measures the high priority traffic flow and assigns the appropriate bandwidth; the remaining bandwidth is used for low priority traffic. It passes a control frame containing the measured bandwidth of the high priority traffic to the other nodes. Based on the advertised high priority traffic bandwidth, any node that is congested transmits, to the other nodes, a fairness message to fairly allocate the remaining low priority bandwidth. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enhances the utilization rate and reduces the delay of high priority frames.",

Monetization process, defined as the enlargement of the sphere of monetary economy, is widely considered one of the most significant aspects of economic development in less developed countries, but other aspects of financial evolution have been also taken into consideration. A time span of twenty years has been adopted in analysing the diffusion of money in the economy, the growth of deposit-money, the evolution of deposit multiplier and the development of quasi-money. To this end several indices have been calculated which seem particularly significant: (1) the ratio between currency outside banks and the GDP; (2) the ratio of money plus quasi-money (M2) to GDP; (3) the ratio of demand deposits to reserve money; (4) the ratio between currency outside banks and total reserve money; (5) the ratio of currency outside banks to money supply (corresponding to the monetary aggregate M1). All these ratios, however, have been assessed with caution because some factors may, in certain circumstances, render them misleading. The analysis of collected data and of calculated indices confirms the persistence in Africa of strong elements of backwardness, even if, at the same time, can be picked out some positive trends such as the growing spread of currency and of deposits with financial institutions. In conclusion can be observed that financial development is underway in most of African countries.",

To evaluate the association between paternal and maternal age at birth with the risk of breast cancer in female offspring, a case-control study was conducted in Korea.MethodsHistologically confirmed breast cancer cases (n = 1,011) and controls (n = 1,011) with no present or previous history of cancer, matched on year of birth and menopausal status, were selected from several teaching hospitals and community in Seoul during 1995–2003. Information on paternal and maternal ages and other factors was collected by interviewed questionnaire. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression model adjusting for family history of breast cancer in 1st or 2nd degree relatives, and lifetime estrogen exposure duration.ResultsThe risk of breast cancer significantly increased as the paternal age increased (p for trend = 0.025). The association was stronger after controlling for maternal age; women whose fathers were aged ≥40 years at their birth had 1.6-fold increased risk of breast cancer compared with fathers aged <30 years. This association was profound in breast cancer cases in premenopausal women (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.12–3.26, for paternal aged ≥40 vs. <30) (p for trend = 0.031). Although the risk of breast cancer increased as maternal age increased up to the intermediate, and then reduced; the risks in women whose mother were aged 25–29, 30–34, and ≥35 yrs at birth compared to women whose mothers were aged <25 years, were 1.2, 1.4, and 0.8, respectively, the trend was not significant (p for trend = 0.998).ConclusionThese findings suggest that older paternal age increases the risk of breast cancer in their female offspring.",

The effect of dynamical localization is adopted to implement a coherent switch, through which the tunneling oscillation is turned on and off with well-preserved phase coherence.

The PIT curriculum includes exercise, nutrition, stress management, and socialization with a focus on strength and endurance training geared towards improving everyday functioning through the increase of awareness and participation in daily healthy lifestyle behaviors. Twenty participants, aged 14-29, attended 90-minute classes at the MUSC Wellness Center twice a week for six weeks and were encouraged to increase their physical activity daily. The mini-Balance Evaluations Systems Test (miniBEST) was administered during the first and last class session to assess balance changes among all study participants over the 6-weeks. Results showed significantly improved balance scores at the end of the program, from 23.9 to 25.2 (p = 0.028).

In other words, the inability to balance among those with ASD may subconsciously alter their initial readiness, empowerment, confidence, and therefore, their willingness to engage in exercise. If individuals with ASD are more likely to avoid behaviors that require them to balance, this may subconsciously drive them to show an increase in interest and participation for behaviors that are primarily sedentary and less physical in nature. This may explain the alarming rates of sedentary behavior, lack of physical activity, and increase in obesity and chronic disease risk that appear more evident among the ASD population. Preliminary research suggests that exercise interventions can not only be beneficial in improving motor issues, but also beneficial in improving social deficits and behavioral problems [29-31]. Additionally, interventions of physical therapists to improve these motor deficits is promising [32]. However, more research is necessary to determine the best protocol for intervention programs to address the aforementioned issues in the ASD population. This Piece It Together research study hopes to illuminate some answers to this question. Piece It Together is a comprehensive wellness intervention program devised to address barriers to holistic wellness specific amongst the population of adolescents and young adults with ASD and other developmental disabilities. The Piece It Together multidisciplinary approach has been created through the collaboration of physicians, physical and occupational therapists, personal trainers, and registered dieticians and tailored to better serve the ASD population. Based on the target population, Piece It Together focuses on five main pillars: exercise, nutrition, socialization, stress relief, and getting out of your comfort zone. Effort is focused on promoting the long-term adoption of healthy lifestyle habits. Additional reports have discussed the effectiveness of the PIT intervention in improving body composition, physical fitness, exercise habits, eating habits, mood, and will discuss success, challenges, and future directions to assist similar programs around the nation. While additional outcomes such as strength, flexibility, depression and anxiety, were collected as part of the larger PIT program, the purpose of this pilot study was to assess balance over the course of the 6-week wellness program.",

        "abstrak":"In the size–weight illusion, when two objects of identical weight but different volume are lifted, the smaller object is typically perceived to weigh more than the larger object. A well-known explanation for this and other weight illusions is provided by the hypothesis that perceived weight results from the contrast between actual and expected weight. More recently, it has been suggested that an object’s size may exert a direct and automatic effect on its perceived weight, independently of expected weight. Here we test these two hypotheses by exploring two illusions that have been known for a long time but have remained relatively underexplored, namely the shape–weight and brightness–weight illusions. Specifically, we measured the influence of visually perceived shape and brightness on the perceived size, the expected weight, and the perceived weight of 3D plastic objects. A numerical rating task was used in Experiment 1, and a paired comparison task was used in Experiment 2. The results showed that spheres were perceived to be heavier than tetrahedrons and cubes, and cubes were perceived to be heavier than tetrahedrons. We did not find any consistent relationship between brightness and perceived weight. A systematic comparison between perceived size, expected weight, and perceived weight showed that the visual shape–weight and brightness–weight illusions are partially inconsistent with the hypothesis that perceived weight results from the contrast between actual and expected weight and with the hypothesis that perceived weight results from the contrast between actual weight and perceived size. The results appear to suggest that there may be a dissociation between the processing of variables that contribute to the conscious experience of size, such as brightness and vertical height, and the processing of variables that contribute to perceived weight, such as surface area.",

The main disadvantage of Dynamic Source Routing Protocol (DSR) is route creation delay during route construction and end-to-end delay during transmission. To solve the above issue, this paper proposed an inventive approach called Hybrid of Destination Sequenced and Dynamic Source routing protocol (HDS2) in MANET. The new approach of HDS2 improves the packet delivery ratio & throughput and minimizes end-to-end delay & route creation.

Multi-factorial assessment and active participation in an evidence-based exercise programme are key interventions to prevent and manage falls.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nto examine older people's experiences of therapeutic exercise as part of a falls prevention service in NHS Trusts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\n\nMETHODS\na cross-sectional survey targeted patients and staff members delivering exercise interventions for reducing falls. A multi-disciplinary group including patient and staff representatives developed a 20-item patient questionnaire and a 12-item staff questionnaire that were distributed to 94 NHS Trusts (113 participating sites within the NHS Trusts) in October 2011.\n\n\nRESULTS\nresponse was 57% for the patient sample and 88% for the staff sample. The median (IQR) age of patients was 82 (77-86) years. 72% were women. Two-thirds reported attending group-based therapeutic exercise classes generally of short duration (80% <12 weeks) and low intensity (85% one class per week) at hospitals and community venues. Balance and strength exercises were prescribed; 68% reported using resistance equipment such as ankle weights and\/or exercise band. Only 52% reported exercises were made more difficult as they improved. However, patient satisfaction levels were high (95% satisfied or very satisfied). Patients and staff reported limited availability of strength and balance follow-up classes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\ndespite high levels of patient satisfaction therapeutic exercise provision was limited and implementation of evidence-based exercise interventions by healthcare providers is incomplete and varies widely.

This study assessed the responsivity to peripheral and central insulin, glucose tolerance, and meal-induced effects of consuming a KD in the rat. After 8 wk of consuming chow or KD, caloric intake after peripheral or central insulin and insulin and glucose levels after a glucose challenge were assessed. In a separate group of rats, glucose and insulin responses to either a low- or high-carbohydrate test meal were measured. Finally, rats maintained on KD were switched back to a chow diet, and insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were evaluated to determine whether the effects of KD were reversible. Maintenance on KD resulted in decreased sensitivity to peripheral insulin and impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, consumption of a high-carbohydrate meal in rats that habitually consumed KD induced significantly greater insulin and glucose levels for an extended period of time, as compared with chow-fed controls. Responsivity to central insulin was heightened in KD rats and associated with increased expression levels of insulin receptor mRNA. Finally, returning to a chow diet rapidly reversed the effects of KD on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These data suggest that maintenance on KD negatively affects glucose homeostasis, an effect that is rapidly reversed upon cessation of the diet.",

Competent environmental evaluation is important for the preservation and enhancement of valuable shore resources. This paper discusses the keypoints of the environmental evaluation method. It also highlights one component of the method: the systemic approach to identification of environmental impacts. In this approach, the shore environment is compartmentalized into five spheres. A matrix system and a computer model are used to identify the direct effects arising from the implementation of given proposed management alternatives and subsequently trace the sequences of indirect effects resulting from the interaction of different processes operating within the five spheres of the environment",

In this study, we reviewed the current state of knowledge about this syndrome, defined diagnostic criteria, provided a long-term follow-up of the disorder, and assessed rehabilitative attempts in affected patients. Use of rigorous criteria that identify patients who have the stiff-man syndrome is important because the initial clinical manifestations are similar to those of other neuromuscular diseases. Analysis of 13 patients with stiff-man syndrome examined at the Mayo Clinic during the past 30 years revealed that treatment with diazepam decreased the muscle spasms. Because some muscle spasms usually persist, rehabilitation is an important adjunct that may further improve function when it is centered on the treatment of low-back pain and hyperlordosis, mobility problems, gait abnormalities, and muscular stiffness.",

The study aims at finding the coefficient of drag and shock wave pattern for 130 mm artillery shell fitted with recovery plug or with fuze, when travelling at zero angle of attack in a supersonic flow of air. The coefficient of drag (CD) obtained from the simulation is used as an input parameter for estimation of trajectory elements. The numerical results, i.e., the coefficient of drag at different Mach numbers and trajectory elements are validated with the data recorded by tracking radar from an experimental firing. Based on numerical results and data recorded in experimental firing, the coefficient of drag in the case of the shell with recovery plug is 2.7 times more than for the shell with fuze. The shock wave in the case of the shell with recovery plug is detached bow shock wave, whereas in the case of a shell with fuze, the shock is attached. The results indicate that the coefficient of drag increases with detached shock wave and an increase in the radius of the shell nose. Good agreements were observed between numerical results and experimental observations.

This study compared the role of sodas with a traditional maize beverage, pozol, in the state of Chiapas, specifically among rural and urban secondary school youth. We found that students find sodas to be desirably “refreshing” and “tasty,” and associated them with wealthier social classes and an alluring vision of modernity. Pozol, on the other hand, was seen as “peasant food” or a poor-person’s drink. Nonetheless, most students have not abandoned its consumption and indeed, for many it represented their most significant daily liquid intake. Importantly, it was seen as more than refreshing libation, serving as a vital food source. We also found that within Chiapanecan society, pozol in fact represents a host of varying versions, whose consumption parallels ethnic, socioeconomic, and rural\/urban factors. Ultimately, some traditional foods have maintained a certain resilience in the face of more globalized foods, in part because of their perceived nutritional and cultural value, thus helping to reinforce the resilience of the peasant agroecology they depend on.",

        "abstrak":"Introduction In this essay I suggest that Heidegger’s Being and Time provides a ground for ethics in the notion of Dasein’s ‘Being-guilty.’ Being-guilty is not a ground for ethics in the sense of a demonstration of the moral ‘ought’ or a refutation of moral skepticism. Rather, Being-guilty serves as a foundation for ethical life in a way uniquely suited to a phenomenological form of ethics, a way that clarifies, from a phenomenological point of view, why the traditional approach to ethics is misguided. The traditional attempt to ground ethics through demonstration or refutation depends upon a misunderstanding of obligation as an imposition that is distinct from, and inflicted upon, the subject in a way that is in need of justification. Heidegger’s conception of Being-guilty, on the contrary, identifies the basis of moral obligation in a form of primary selfobligation that is constitutive of human nature, rather than an imposition upon it. Although primordial guilt or self-obligation does not justify ethical obligation, it does ‘ground’ ethics. For it is the primary source and support of our ethical activity in two distinct senses. First, it serves as the condition for the possibility of our indebtedness to others—it enables us to be morally obligated. It enables moral obligation towards others by determining Dasein as ontologically indebted to care for its own being—a being which is, in turn, ontologically determined as care for others. Second, Being-guilty provides a criterion for distinguishing what we call ethical and unethical behavior. Ethical behaviour is distinguished according to the appropriateness of one’s care for the Other according to proper recognition of the nature of the Other’s Being as Dasein.",

I focus on the role of the managerial function known as channel marketing, the task of which is to minimize friction, achieve coordination and add value in the distribution of the company’s products. However, the path to achieving these objectives is challenged because members of the marketing channel, or intermediaries, may not be contractual members of the channel; in fact they may have widely divergent goals or may even be hostile to the manufacturer’s efforts at control. This can be construed to be the case for physicians and others who are in the pharmaceutical manufacturer’s distribution channel but not of it. Their views and actions must somehow be brought into alignment with the manufacturer’s goals. This paper seeks to show part of the process from the manufacturer’s strategic standpoint, in which potential dissenters are incorporated into the pharmaceutical company distribution channel. The routinization of this incorporation results in the diminishment of psychiatry’s professional autonomy by means of what is—paradoxically to them, but not to a student of marketing—a competitive threat.

        "abstrak":"A Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) model for the vibration analysis of three-layered sandwich beams is presented. The governing differential equations of motion of the sandwich beam for the general case, when the properties of each layer are dissimilar, are exploited. Displacement fields are imposed such that the face layers follow the Rayleigh beam assumptions, while the core is governed by Timoshenko beam theory. The DFE model is then used to examine the free-vibration characteristics of an asymmetric soft-core sandwich beam with steel face layers and a rubber core. The natural frequency results for the first four modes, in this case, show the exact match between the DFE and ‘exact’ Dynamic Stiffness Matrix (DSM) formulations, using only a one-element mesh, justifying the use of Quasi-Exact (QE-DFE) title. Convergence-wise, the QE-DFE formulation also outperforms the conventional FEM, which makes it useful in benchmarking other studies or the examination of high frequency response where FEM requires the use of large number of elements in order to achieve better accuracy. The application of the DFE to a lead-core sandwich beam is also discussed.",

As many know, in the last decades the scholars in procedural law have chosen a more realistic approach. The so-called ‘case management’ is more and more often looked at as the point of balance between the search for efficient procedures and the need for a quality decision. The thread running through Civil Litigation in China and Europe is exploring how and why, with a few exceptions, the modern reforms of civil procedure in the world tend to increase the procedural efficiency providing for enough judicial ‘managerial’ powers, even though with the constant worry to avoid harming the fundamental principles of party disposition and of the impartiality of the judge. The second, though not less important, goal of this collection of essays is to provide both Chinese and European scholars with information on each other’s procedural system in the English language, thus facilitating research that is often rendered nearly impossible by language barriers. As the two editors Remco van Rhee and Fu Yulin explain in the first introductory chapter, the book is also intended for the law reformers who want to explore the multiple ways of improving judicial case management in their own countries. The book is divided into seven parts, belonging to the original research project, sponsored by the European union and the People’s Republic of China, which deal with I – China: Mainland, II – China: Hong Kong, III – Austria & germany, IV – Croatia,",

The research which we carried out was of the retrospective type and it lasted two years. The patients were recruited at the division out-clinic and locally. All the examinations were carried out at the division, using the method of Vabra aspirator with the Kit of Sterilab. The patients admitted to examination showed some menstrual anomalies, (spotting, abnormal uterine bleeding, metrorrhagias and after postmenopausal uterine bleeding), and stayed at our USSL or at neighbouring ones. The cytologic examination have been read beside a single centre and the cytologic diagnosis has been compared with the histology one on the operating organ. The result obtained agrees with the literature. In fact, out of 888 screened women, 656 were aged over 40 and 232 aged less than 40. In the group of 656 patients 3 adenocarcinoma have been diagnosed and 4 atypical hyperplasia, equivalent to 0.33% and to 0.45% respectively. In conclusion, we can say that the method has shown a good diagnostic reliability into the diagnosis of malignant neoplasia. According to other authors, its limit is, instead, the high number of inadequate, besides the impossibility to diagnose other uterine pathologies, such as the endometrial polyps and the uterine myoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Most molecular events in enucleation remain unclear. Here we show that enucleation requires establishment of cell polarization that is regulated by the microtubule-dependent local activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). When the nucleus becomes displaced to one side of the cell, actin becomes restricted to the other side, where dynamic cytoplasmic contractions generate pressure that pushes the viscoelastic nucleus through a narrow constriction in the cell surface, forming a bud. The PI3K products PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are highly localized at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. PI3K inhibition caused impaired cell polarization, leading to a severe delay in enucleation. Depolymerization of microtubules reduced PI3K activity, resulting in impaired cell polarization and enucleation. We propose that enucleation is regulated by microtubules and PI3K signaling in a manner mechanistically similar to directed cell locomotion.",

One-step gelation method was used herein for the synthesis of a biomimetic PVA-BA\/PEG hydrogel with porous bilayer structure. Importantly, two layers were integrated closely and both showed porous network. The upper layer of this hydrogel could show high compressive tangent modulus to resist deformation during friction; in the meantime, its bottom layer was able to prevent the leakage of interstitial water and increase the consumption of load. Due to porous high-water-content hydrogel bulk inside bottom layer, this cast-dry PVA-BA\/PEG hydrogel could show close to 70% of water-retention capacity. On the other hand, the complexation of BA and PVA greatly strengthened the stability of the polymer network for the PVA-BA\/PEG hydrogel. Therefore, the PVA-BA\/PEG hydrogel could achieve an excellent combination of high mechanical properties and low friction coefficient. When the addition of BA was 1.4 wt %, the tensile strength of the PVA-BA\/PEG hydrogel reached 4.41 MPa at an elongation of 573% and its compressive tangent modulus was 4.6 MPa at a strain of 60%. The COF of the hydrogel under water lubrication or calf serum was very low even at a high load, which is of high application potential for the articular cartilage repair.",

In our game show, the potential awakenings of Sleeping Beauty, during which she will be asked about the outcome of the coin toss that determined earlier how many times she is awakened and asked, are replaced by potential contestants, deciding whether to choose heads or tails in a bet they will get to place if chosen as contestants on the outcome of the coin toss that determined earlier how many of them are chosen as contestants. This game show bears out the basic intuition of the thirders. Our goal in this paper, however, is not to settle the dispute between halfers and thirders but to draw attention to our game-show proxy itself, which realizes a version of the Sleeping Beauty Problem without the ambiguities plaguing the original. In this spirit, we design similar game-show proxies for variations on the Sleeping Beauty Problem with stochastic experiments other than a coin toss. We do the same for a variation in which Sleeping Beauty must decide upon being awakened whether or not to switch doors in the famous Monty Hall Problem and have the number of awakenings during which she gets to make that decision depend on the door she picked before she was put to sleep. 1 The Three Stooges on Monty Hall Consider the following puzzle.

Through textual analysis and references to theories of film stardom, I examine the film’s attempt to manufacture a star identity through his involvement in a culturally disreputable form – the pornographic feature film. \nThe term ‘porn star’ is a frequently deployed oxymoron, marrying a despised, marginalised and (at least in the 1970s) criminalised industry with the notion of the idolised, idealised and beautified performer. In 'Exhausted', there emerges a pronounced disjuncture between the star persona that the film wishes to construct, and that which the film’s subject is willing (and able) to project. Consequently, the film is a naive attempt to present an image of Holmes for popular consumption. However, through behind-the-scenes vignettes, film clips and interviews, it is also an insight into the complex relationship between a novice female director, an undisciplined, wayward and uncontrollable masculine presence, and an audience still in the early stages of understanding the form, function and language of the adult film. \nThe film emerged at a transitional point both for the adult film industry and Holmes himself – the gradual decline of theatrically released adult films in the 1980s mirrored his descent into drug addiction, a multiple-murder charge and eventual death from AIDS in 1988. Looking at the film today allows us a valuable insight into Holmes’ historical and cultural function within the ghetto of the American adult film industry.",

BSAR frequency-domain processing algorithms are efficient ways of image formation in comparison to ideal two-dimensional matched filtering and to relatively accurate and time-consuming time-domain algorithms. Among these frequency-domain algorithms, omega-K is the most precise. The starting and key step of frequency-domain algorithms is the derivation of bistatic spectrum. Recently, a new bistatic spectrum is reported, which is probably the latest and the most modified version of Loffeld's bistaic formula (LBF), maintaining its accuracy even in azimuth-variant configurations with high squint angles. So far, this spectrum has only been used within range-Doppler algorithm to process BSAR data. The authors investigate the possibility and results of applying this modified version of LBF as a basis for omega-K algorithm. Two approaches, based on Stolt interpolation and inverse scaled Fourier transform, are examined and their effectiveness in general azimuth-variant geometry is validated through several simulations. The proposed implementations show higher performance in terms of image quality measurements as compared to extended LBF-based implementations.",

We had previously observed that, during exercise, metabolic clearance rate of glucose (MCR) increases markedly in normal, but only marginally in poorly controlled diabetic dogs. We wished to determine (i) whether in a more general model of stress matched increases in rate of appearance of glucose and MCR also occur, or if MCR is suppressed, as during catecholamine infusion; and (ii) whether diabetes affects stress-induced changes in rate of glucose appearance and MCR. Therefore, we injected carbachol (27 nmol\/50 microliters), an analog of acetylcholine, intracerebroventricularly in seven conscious dogs before and after induction of alloxan diabetes. In normal dogs, plasma epinephrine and cortisol increased 4- to 5-fold, whereas norepinephrine and glucagon doubled. Plasma insulin, however, remained unchanged. Tracer-determined hepatic glucose production increased rapidly, but transiently, by 2.5-fold. This increment can be fully explained by the observed increments in the counterregulatory hormones. Surprisingly, however, MCR also promptly increased, and therefore, plasma glucose changed only marginally. After induction of diabetes, the animals were given intracerebroventricular carbachol while plasma glucose was maintained at moderate hyperglycemia (9.0 +\/- 0.4 mM). Increments in counterregulatory hormones were similar to those seen in normal dogs, except for exaggerated norepinephrine release. Peripheral insulin levels were higher in diabetic than in normal dogs; however, MCR was markedly reduced and the lipolytic response to stress increased, indicating insulin resistance. Interestingly, the hyperglycemic response to stress was 6-fold greater in diabetic than normal animals, relating mainly to the failure of MCR to rise. Plasma lactate increased equivalently in diabetic and normal animals despite suppression of MCR in the diabetics, indicating either greater muscle glycogenolysis and\/or impairment in glucose oxidation. We conclude that in this stress model MCR increases as in exercise in normal but not in diabetic dogs. We speculate that glucose uptake in stress could be mediated through an insulin-dependent neural mechanism.",

Overall, then, it shows that attending to these processes reveals complex mechanisms of knowledge production and circulation along with the invisibility\/visibility dialectics that lies at their core.",

Douglass, SET Associates The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) along with other organizations is actively pursuing the development of armed combat robots that operate with potentially significant degrees of autonomy. For example, the DARPA\/IXO Raiders initiative envisions a combined force of air and ground robots that could detect hostile military rifle fire and return fire in a largely autonomous fashion with a high degree of precision. Such concepts combined with emerging technology hold promise for effectively killing a high percentage of hostile forces, but raise an important question in terms of their impact on collateral damage. In a broader context with the advent of weapons that can be selected to produce any scale of destruction desired, western warfare in general becomes driven by issues of collateral damage. In this paper, we review emerging concepts of combat robots, propose a model for estimating the risk of collateral damage, and offer a quantitative comparison of collateral damage expected in human and robotic engagements. We argue that use of combat robots can dramatically reduce the risk of collateral damage compared to current practice and concepts of operation. In conclusion, we propose key research and technology challenges related to the reduction of non-combatant casualties through the use of intelligent robotic command and control strategies. While estimates of both non-combatant and combatant deaths vary widely, most values for conflicts ranging from WWI through the current campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan fall within a non-combatant to combatant ratio of 0.5 to 2.0. Today, many nations have a range of munitions and delivery technology at their disposal that permits them to decimate large areas and obtain very high probabilities of killing hostile forces. Understanding this potential, hostile forces have increasingly sought to intermingle themselves and their materiel with civilian populations. At the same time, the political cost of collateral damage to non-combatant populations has steadily increased. Consequently, a central thrust of new command and control technology should be the reduction of collateral damage, specifically non-combatant casualties. We present an analytical model that relates collateral damage to weapon’s effects radius, range to target, probability of detection, probability of false alarm, pointing accuracy, CEP of the weapon, CEP of the detection, and density of non-combatants. We compare the predictions of the analytical model to actual combat fatalities and to the Raiders robotic combat concept and quantitatively show the reduction in collateral damage that may be achieved with robotic forces combined with innovative command and control technology. The Raiders concepts consists of air and ground robots networked with unattended ground sensors to acoustically detect shots from high velocity rifles, localize their source with high precision, and rapidly return fire from close range. Because the Raiders force is unmanned, it can move much closer to hostile forces without risking the human lives of 2004 C2 R&T Symposium 2 Kott\/Douglass 2004 C2 R&T Symposium 3 Kott\/Douglass its own force. Reducing the range to the target increases the accuracy of fire thereby maintaining a high probability of kill while simultaneously permitting the use of smaller weapons with a reduced blast area. Reducing weapons size in turns reduces the potential for collateral damage. Key to the Raiders’ strategy is an intelligent command and control scheme that uses automated planning and adversarial modeling to position the robots to be in the right place at the right time so that shots can be sensed and located precisely and return fire can be directed from close range with great accuracy using smaller munitions. The result is an effective robotic fighting force that also holds the promise of reducing non-combatant casualties.",

He had significant, debilitating pain and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a complex contrast-enhancing mass with significant associated edema. Positron emission tomography demonstrated an FDG avid lesion within the brachial plexus that was confirmed by biopsy to be neuritis ossificans. The patient was treated with indomethacin and had clinical and radiographic improvement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe present the only case of diffuse, brachial plexus neuritis ossificans. Given the challenges of surgical resection in this region, we believe medical management for complex brachial plexus lesions should be considered first, unless the sequela of the disease is sufficiently prolonged or there is concern for permanent neurovascular compromise.",

Macular amyloidosis is a rare form of localised cutaneous amyloidosis of obscure aetiology. In contrast to most localised amyloidosis, the precursor protein(s) of both macular amyloidosis and prolactinoma are unknown. A 35-year-old man with chronic headache (six years), blurring of vision (three years), and hyperpigmented macular lesion involving arms, legs, and back (two years) was diagnosed to have hyperprolactinaemia (8927 ng\/mL) and secondary adrenal insufficiency. MRI revealed pituitary macroadenoma compressing the optic chiasma, encasing the right carotid artery and extending into the sphenoid sinus. A biopsy of skin from the right upper arm revealed thickened stratum corneum, acanthosis, and deposition of pale eosinophilic material in papillary dermis that gave a rose pink colour under methyl-violet and appeared congophilic with Congo red stain, which under polarised light showed green birefringence, diagnostic of macular amyloidosis. Headache, bitemporal haemianopia, and skin lesion improved following cabergoline therapy. Temporal profile of the disease characterised by symptoms of macroprolactinoma preceding onset of macular amyloidosis with resolution of symptoms of macroprolactinoma, accompanied by reductions in prolactin, and concomitant improvement in macular amyloidosis with cabergoline therapy may suggest some link between macroprolactinoma and macular amyloidosis.

Their restructuring has been marked by an abrupt transition from the centralized economy and totalitarianism of the communist period to the free market economy of new capitalism and democracy, under pressures for regionalization and globalization. The article looks at how City Hall texts (available in print and in digitalized form on the City Hall website) draw upon a historically rooted discourse of regional multiculturalism, constantly rearticulating it with EU neoliberal discourses of economic growth and competitiveness, participatory democracy, and interregional cooperation. The texts are thus seen as part of an ongoing strategy employed by the local authorities to rescale the city of Timişoara, the capital of the Banat region (near the western border of the country), as an emerging multicultural regional centre and a pole of mobility. This process is taking place against the backdrop of the recontextualization of the region’s historic identity in academic texts produced by local (mostly) intellectuals, who are concerned with a reassessment of the concepts of ‘Central Europe’ and interculturalism in the postcommunist context.",

Methods: Forty one patients who underwent CABG with (Group 1, n = 20) and without (Group 2, n = 21) acute normovolemic hemodilution were enrolled in this study. Activated clotting time (ACT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), D-dimer (fibrin degradation product), fibrinogen, protein C and S, and platelet count were measured. Blood samples were collected after induction of anesthesia, 20 minutes after the beginning of CPB, 30 minutes after administration of protamine, and 24 hours after the weaning from CPB. Transfused blood products and mediastinal bleeding were recorded. Results: Within both groups, D-dimer elevated, and protein C values and platelet count decreased significantly at all samples compared with preoperative values. The changes of ACT, PT, aPTT, D-dimer, fibrinogen, protein C and S and platelet count were similar in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences between both groups with respect to the blood transfusion and mediastinal bleeding.

Based on this widely accepted concept, at least 35–40% of newly diagnosed cancers fall into this definition (2). This concept has been useful for its clinical implications, and has lead to the use of anti-estrogenic\/anti-androgenic treatments for sex hormone responsive cancers, as well as to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppressive therapy with l-thyroxine (-T4) for differentiated thyl -roid cancer. Moreover, several studies have tried to identify physiological conditions, such as early menarche, late menopause, age of first pregnancy, and number of preg-nancies, prolonged lactation, and obesity, that may all affect sex steroids availabil-ity\/exposure and modulate cancer risk. Another series of studies have identified germline polymorphisms, which are linked to the modulation of cancer risk through the genetic control of serum hormone lev-els or target tissue responses (3). Finally, other studies have addressed the possi-ble effects of the exposure to exogenous sex hormones, such as estroprogestins (4) or postmenopausal estrogen replac-ing therapy (5) or endocrine disruptors (6). While all these studies have provided useful information for cancer prevention and treatment, our understanding of how genetic traits relevant to hormone action, control and interaction with physiological conditions, hormonal supplementations, and environmental factors is still limited. Another grand challenge is represented by the possibility to achieve effective and risk-free chemoprevention for subjects predisposed to individual endocrine related cancers, as exemplified by the use of tamoxifen and other agents in breast cancer predisposed subjects (6).In recent years, several studies have challenged this classical view of endocrine related cancer. We now summarize recent data, which should be taken into account to reformulate the term “endocrine related cancer” in a more expanded way.",

Especially in the last decade, international RE trade has been changing in the trade community and trade volume. Based on complex network theory, we built an unweighted and weighted network to explore the evolution of the communities and identify the role of the major countries in the RE trade. The results show that an international RE trade network was dispersed and unstable because of the existence of five to nine trade communities in the unweighted network and four to eight trade communities in the weighted network in the past 13 years. Moreover, trade groups formed due to the great influence of geopolitical relations. China was often associated with the South America and African countries in the same trade group.

At the same time, researchers, clinicians, and medical professionals treating PwMS with mood disorders have spoken about the difficulty they face when having to determine a diagnosis of depression in this population. This difficulty arises because both MS and depression share various psychological and neurological symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain, sleep difficulties, psychomotor retardation, and cognitive difficulties). It is also found that these overlapped symptoms vary when completing a self-report measure of depression, versus when medically diagnosed by a psychiatrist. As such, we aim to investigate the personal and disease-related factors that are associated with self-reported depressive symptoms and medically diagnosed depression (i.e. depression diagnosed by a medical professional). Following this, we aim to determine the risk factors for depression in older PwMS. \nThis study used secondary data collected from the original study, the Canadian survey of health, lifestyle, and aging with multiple sclerosis. Data of the original study was collected from 743 Canadians (> 55 years of age and living with MS for >20 years). In this present study, presence of self-reported depressive symptoms was defined as a score of ≥ 8 on the depression component of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D). Presence of medically diagnosed depression was determined by the item that asked participants if they have received a diagnosis of depression by their medical professional. Logistic regression was used to identify variables that predicted depression. \nSelf-reported depressive symptoms were found in 30.5% of the population, while medically diagnosed depression was found in 25.7%. 11.7% of PwMS had both self-identified depressive symptoms and were diagnosed with depression by their medical professional. Low social support, high perceived disability, and additional comorbid physical conditions were independent predictors of depression in older PwMS in our cohort. \nDepression is prevalent in older PwMS. Clinicians should be cognizant of the overlap of symptoms between MS and depression and should employ possible ways to minimize over-diagnosing or underdiagnosing depression in this population. Identifying risk factors for depression is imperative because at-risk individuals may be thoroughly assessed for depression and will be able to receive treatment more promptly.",

        "abstrak":"Abstract A large-scale field experiment was conducted over four seasons on a gleysol (24% clay in topsoil) in Scotland. Conventional ploughing, shallow ploughing and shallow rotary or tine cultivation were investigated for the incorporation of straw in winter barley. Straw after harvest was either chopped or removed. Thus the residue treatments were either straw plus stubble or stubble only. Incorporation depths ranged from 0–100 to 0–300 mm. The presence of straw changed soil physical conditions after several seasons in which straw was incorporated. In the ploughed treatments, the presence of straw plus stubble decreased the average soil water content and matric potential in the topsoil in comparison to stubble only, indicating more rapid drainage. This was associated with the presence of buried straw in zones of loose soil just above plough depth and with a long-term increase in soil pore continuity related to the presence of straw residues. The presence of straw plus stubble under conventional ploughing decreased thermal diffusivities in the top 150 mm of soil in comparison with stubble only. Shallow incorporation of straw plus stubble gave higher overall strengths, bulk densities, lower water infiltration rates and poorer drainage in the topsoil than deeper incorporation. However, shallow incorporation caused an accumulation of organic matter over the first three seasons. This accumulation probably contributed to the increased aggregate stability and resistance to compaction of the top 50-mm soil layer, indicating improved resistance to erosion and to further compaction.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that TRKA and its ligand, nerve growth factor (NGF), may play a role in normal hematopoiesis and may be deregulated in leukemogenesis. Here, we report a comprehensive evaluation of TRKA signaling in normal and leukemic cells. TRKA expression is highest in common myeloid progenitors and is overexpressed in core binding factor and megakaryocytic leukemias, especially Down syndrome-related AML. Importantly, NGF can rescue GM-CSF dependent TF-1 AML cells, but does not drive proliferation in other TRKA-expressing lines. Although TRKA expression is heterogeneous between and within AML samples, NGF stimulation broadly induces ERK signaling, demonstrating the functional ability of AML cells to respond to NGF\/TRKA signaling. However, neither shRNA knockdown nor pharmacologic inhibition have significant anti-proliferative effects on human AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, despite functional NGF\/TRKA signaling, the importance of TRKA in AML remains unclear.",

        "abstrak":"BackgroundAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual impairment in the elderly. The neovascular (wet) form of AMD can be treated with intravitreal injections of different anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. Placental growth factor (PGF) is another member of the VEGF family of cytokines with pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory effects. Here, we aimed to compare single and combined inhibition of VEGF-A and PGF in the laser-induced mouse model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with a focus on the effects on retinal mononuclear phagocytes.MethodsCNV was induced in C57BL\/6J mice using a YAG-Laser. Immediately after laser damage antibodies against VEGF-A (aVEGF), anti-PGF (aPGF), aVEGF combined with aPGF, aflibercept, or IgG control were injected intravitreally in both eyes. Three and 7 days after laser damage, the vascular leakage was determined by fluorescence angiography. Lectin staining of retinal and RPE\/choroidal flat mounts was used to monitor CNV. In situ mRNA co-expression of Iba1, VEGF and PGF were quantified using in situ hybridization. Retinal and RPE\/choroidal protein levels of VEGF and PGF as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL1-beta, and TNF were determined by ELISA.ResultsEarly (day 3) and intermediate (day 7) vascular leakage and CNV were significantly inhibited by PGF and VEGF-A co-inhibition, most effectively with the trap molecule aflibercept. While VEGF-A blockage alone had no effects, trapping PGF especially with aflibercept prevented the accumulation of reactive microglia and macrophages in laser lesions. The lesion-related mRNA expression and secretion of VEGF-A and PGF by mononuclear phagocytes were potently suppressed by PGF and partially by VEGF-A inhibition. Protein levels of IL-6 and IL1-beta were strongly reduced in all treatment groups.ConclusionsRetinal inhibition of PGF in combination with VEGF-A prevents vascular leakage and CNV possibly via modulating their own expression in mononuclear phagocytes. PGF-related, optimized strategies to target inflammation-mediated angiogenesis may help to increase efficacy and reduce non-responders in the treatment of wet AMD patients.",

All patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT group) and surgical intervention or induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (C-->CRT group) and surgical intervention. Survival analysis (excluding operative mortality) evaluated various pretreatment factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMultivariable Cox regression analysis showed that pretreatment endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy was a significant predictor of decreased long-term survival (P = .03). Median and 3-year survivals were 49 months and 54% in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cN0 M0 group (n = 65), 45 months and 56% in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cN1 M0 group (n = 96), and 19 months and 12% in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy (cM1a) group (n = 18; P = .03). Increased systemic relapse was noted in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cM1a group (44% vs 22%, P = .07). The only factor associated with increased survival in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cM1a group (27 vs 15 months, P = .02) was the addition of induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemoradiotherapy and surgical intervention.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEndoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus conveys a poor prognosis despite preoperative chemoradiotherapy. These patients should be stratified in future multimodality trials. The investigation of induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemoradiotherapy might be warranted in this high-risk group of patients.",

The effects of these solutions on aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, moulds, coliforms, the presence of some mycotoxins (aflatoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone), the cytotoxicity and diastatic power (DP) of sorghum malt was evaluated. Steeping NK 283 in 0.1% Ca(OH)2 increased the DP from 10.5 to 16 Sorghum Diastatic Units (SDU)\/g. However, it did not reduce the general levels of malt microflora. Steeping in dilute NaOH reduced the microflora on the malt. Steeping both grain cultivars with 0.2% NaOH resulted in malts with the moulds and coliforms reduced to approximately 3.5 and 2.0 log colony forming units\/g, respectively and the percentages of some mould species to very low or undetectable levels. The DP of the 0.2% NaOH steeped malts increased to 16.2 and 26.9 SDU\/g in the NK 283 and PAN 8546, respectively.

Students of feeding behaviour typically explain this behaviour by saying that animals discount delayed benefits.

This paper presents a new explanation of short-sighted decision-making called the discrimination advantage model that does not rely on discounting. A new model that includes several possible causes of discounting is developed. This model has many interesting features, but it cannot account for two empirical results: the strength of the 'discounting' effect and the fact that the time between choice presentations (the intertrial interval or ITI) has no effect. This leads to the conclusion that although discounting may be important it is probably not a complete explanation of the experimental facts. In the discrimination advantage model the observation that the ITI does not affect choice is seen as a strategy to make a cleaner discrimination between delayed alternatives in a noisy world. A simple example shows that when discrimination is imperfect a short-sighted choice rule can, in some situations, lead to a higher long-term rate than a rule that actually compares long-term rates.

London: UK Faculty of Public Health, 2014) sets out 12 compelling priorities for the protection of people's health. The focus of this document is preventative, calling for a comprehensive strategy to target a wide-ranging set of challenges to public health; however, it fails to mention child maltreatment and its negative impact on long-term health outcomes. In this article, we explore the long-term negative consequences of child maltreatment and how these can be conceptually aligned with four different characteristics of long-term health conditions. We suggest that situating child maltreatment within a long-term conditions framework could have significant advantages and implications for practice, policy and research, by strengthening a commitment across disciplines to apply evidence-based principles linked with policy and evaluation and recognizing the chronic effects of maltreatment to concentrate public, professional and government awareness of the extent and impact of the issue. We argue that a public health approach is the most effective way of focusing preventative efforts on the long-term sequelae of child maltreatment and to foster cooperation in promoting children's rights to grow and develop in a safe and caring environment free from violence and abuse.",

        "tahun_terbit":1995,
        "abstrak":"Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), released fiom the heart of most vertebrates, has hypotensive, natriuretic and diuretic effects. In mammals, the primary stimulus for ANF release is atrial detension, but in fish the mechanisms mediating ANF release from the heart are unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear how much the atrium and the ventricle contribute to total ANF release. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were to: 1) quantitatively describe the location of ANF in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) heart; and 2) investigate the mechanistic factors influencing its release fiom the in situ trout heart. In addition, as ionic regulation differs between freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) fish, and ANF is involved in sodium regulation, the factors mediating ANF release fiom the trout heart were investigated in both FW and SW fish. Using imrnunogold labeling, dense ANF secretary granules were identified in both the atrial and ventricular myocardium. However, these secretory granules were considerably more numerous in the atrium than in the ventricle. To quantify the absolute amount of ANF in the trout atrium and ventricle, ANF was assayed using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) specific for human ANF-(99-126). Preliminary studies using Western blot analysis had confirmed that human ANF effectively cross-reacts with trout ANF. Immunoreactive ANF (ir-ANF) content in the atrium and ventricle was 3.10 & 0.24 ngeg-l wet tissue weight and 0.04 k 0.01 ngWg-l wet tissue weight, respectively (N = 7). Thus, the atrium contained 92% of the total ir-ANF stored in the heart. The results fiom the imrnunogold labeling, when combined with those fiom the direct measurement of irANF in atrial and ventricular extracts, strongly suggest that the atrium is the primary source of ANF in rainbow trout. In the FW perfused trout hearts, ANF secretion at basal filling pressures was unaffected by increases in afterload. This suggests that stretch of the atrium and not the",

        "abstrak":"With only a small number of their students coming from families with the lowest incomes (10% from the bottom two family income quintiles), the nation's most selective private colleges and universities need to know why. Two ready ideological answers are (1) that low-income high-ability students are being excluded in order to favor the children of society's most advantaged or (2) that very few low-income high-ability students exist - that by college age, low-income students have been so damaged by education, nutrition, neighborhoods, and families that few can qualify in a perfectly fair admissions process. This paper uses the national population of high school test-takers in 2003 to examine the national distribution over family incomes of high-ability students (variously defined). With these data, two questions can be addressed. What would be the target share of low-income students at these schools if their student bodies were to mirror the national high-ability population? And, are they out there - do there exist enough such low- income, high-ability students to meet those targets? It is shown that they are out there - that a somewhat larger share of the test-taking population is made up of high-ability, low-income students than are found in these schools and that their numbers make it feasible for the schools to increase their enrollments to target that national share. Because much depends on the definition of \"high-ability\" used, we consider alternative definitions but reach the same conclusion at any reasonable level (like a minimum combined SAT of 1300 or even 1420).",

This qualitative study explores caregiver experiences of feeding before and after a community‐based training program in Ghana. Methods Thirteen caregivers of children with CP, who were severely undernourished, were interviewed at the start of the training program. Eleven of these were interviewed again after a year of monthly group trainings and home visits, which included guidance on feeding. Four additional caregivers were interviewed at end line. Interviews explored caregivers’ mealtime experiences, as well as a 24‐hr dietary recall and a structured feeding observation checklist. Children's nutritional status was assessed by anthropometry. Results Caregivers found mealtimes stressful due to time demands, messiness, and the pressure of providing enough quality food. They felt that the training program had helped reduced this stress and dietary recall data suggested some improved dietary quality. However, there was neither improvement nor deterioration in anthropometric status of the children. Conclusion Group trainings were welcomed by caregivers and notably reduced stress around feeding times. However, future work is needed in order to improve anthropometric outcomes, including, but not limited to, greater focus on nutritional requirements during caregiver training interventions. Therapeutic feeding programs must also be better utilized and need to be better equipped to care for this group of children, including deviating from standard admission and treatment protocols.",

        "tahun_terbit":2003,
        "abstrak":"Stepping-stone models for the ecological dynamics of metapopulations are often used to address general questions about the effects of spatial structure on the nature and complexity of population fluctuations. Such models describe an ensemble of local and spatially isolated habitat patches that are connected through dispersal. Reproduction and hence the dynamics in a given local population depend on the density of that local population, and a fraction of every local population disperses to neighboring patches. In such models, interesting dynamic phenomena, e.g. the persistence of locally unstable predator–prey interactions, are only observed if the local dynamics in an isolated patch exhibit non-equilibrium behavior. Therefore, the scope of these models is limited. Here we extend these models by making the biologically plausible assumption that reproductive success in a given local habitat not only depends on the density of the local population living in that habitat, but also on the densities of neighboring local populations. This would occur if competition for resources occurs between neighboring populations, e.g. due to foraging in neighboring habitats. With this assumption of quasi-local competition the dynamics of the model change completely. The main difference is that even if the dynamics of the local populations have a stable equilibrium in isolation, the spatially uniform equilibrium in which all local populations are at their carrying capacity becomes unstable if the strength of quasi-local competition reaches a critical level, which can be calculated analytically. In this case the metapopulation reaches a new stable state, which is, however, not spatially uniform anymore and instead results in an irregular spatial pattern of local population abundance. For large metapopulations, a huge number of different, spatially non-uniform equilibrium states coexist as attractors of the metapopulation dynamics, so that the final state of the system depends critically on the initial conditions. The existence of a large number of attractors has important consequences when environmental noise is introduced into the model. Then the metapopulation performs a random walk in the space of all attractors. This leads to large and complicated population fluctuations whose power spectrum obeys a red-shifted power law. Our theory reiterates the potential importance of spatial structure for ecological processes and proposes new mechanisms for the emergence of non-uniform spatial patterns of abundance and for the persistence of complicated temporal population fluctuations.",

Regarding to the limitation and deficiency of energy – exergy combination, a new method named exergy destruction level (EDL) and conceptual diagram based on equipment target value is proposed for process equipment with pressure and chemical composition changes. The effects of different operational parameters on the component separation are evaluated by sensitivity analysis. Eventually response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial intelligence (DE) method are developed for optimization of the chemical plant. Comparing obtained results from ethylene plant optimization by using RSM and DE, it was found that annual profit percentage with DE method is 61.6% more than RSM method. Also, results of optimization showed that the most effective operating parameters consist of feed stream temperature, boil-up ratio, reflux ratio, column pressure and feed stage. It was observed that utilities and refrigeration cycle consumption work have been declined significantly by using DE optimizer and EDL analysis (12.6% and 11.6%) compared to RSM optimizer and exergy analysis (11.9% and 4.8%). It is obvious that, EDL analysis and DE method expedite process optimization and provide more precise analysis than conventional energy-exergy analysis.",

Extracting co-morbidity scores using the Charlson Co-Morbidity Index (CCI) and ACE-27, and also using further accessible data with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) has been proposed by the National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN) to help to determine fitness for ageing cancer patients. However, re-cording co-morbidity has limitations. This prospective cohort study was carried out to measure co-morbidity with differing methodology to validate the use of different source data and recorder analysis and to try and predict how well patients tolerated chemotherapy according to their comorbidity scores. Methods\/Summarised description of the project: Between August 2009 and August 2011, patients aged 18 and over undergoing a new course of cytotoxic chemotherapy, independent of setting and intent, were approached. Following consent, standard demographic variables, tumour type\/stage, chemotherapy regimen and doses were recorded. Regarding co-morbidity scores, hospital notes and General Practitioner (GP)\/Primary Physician summaries were accessed, and CCI and ACE-27 scores generated. The scoring was carried out both by a physician and a health care assistant independently, in order to look at the correlation of scores. HES data was also accessed, and CCI scores were generated from this. Severe chemotherapy toxicity was defined as grade III\/IV toxicity, dose reduction, unplanned hospitalisation, treatment discontinuation, or death within 30 days of treatment. A total of 507 patients were recruited, 185 of which were over the age of 65. Correlation of co-morbidity scoring, between physician and health care assistant, was analysed with Cohen's kappa and stated as substantial if 0.61≤kappa≤0.80 and good if kappaN0.80. Implementation with Chi-squared statistics was recorded to assess significance of co-morbidity scores and prediction of severe chemotherapy toxicity. Results: For the over 65 age group, the kappa score between physician and health care assistant CCI score using hospital notes and GP summaries were 0.467 (±0.056 SE) and 0.434 (±0.064 SE) respectively. The kappa score between physician and health care assistant ACE-27 score using hospital notes and GP summaries were 0.374 (±0.054 SE) and 0.155 (±0.069 SE) respectively. Regarding prediction of tolerance to chemotherapy and co-morbidity, there was no significant correlation found both with CCI (Score 0–1 vs. ≥2, χ=0.164, p=0.685) and ACE-27 (Score 0–1 vs. ≥2, χ=1.090, p=0.296) and severe chemotherapy toxicity. Data regarding correlation of HES-derived score (undergoing process), will be presented at SIOG 2012. Conclusions: There appeared to be no substantial correlation between scoring of co-morbidity between physician and health care assistant. There was no significant correlation that higher comorbidity scores were predictive of severe chemotherapy toxicity.",

        "abstrak":"We read with interest comments from Spacek and Solga regarding our work on regret-based decision making for intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We thank them for the opportunity to further elucidate our approach. First, we described that clinicians “can be aggressive” recommending resection to all patients with intermediate HCCs. This statement should be viewed in light of international Eauropean Association for the Study of the Liver and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines that recommend only transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in all patients with intermediate HCC. In this regard, surgery can be described as more aggressive and the nonparallel construction of the regret decision curve analysis (DCA) is forced by the avoidance of guidelines in recommending resection for intermediate HCC. Second, when stating that “. . .surgeons were more prone to experience the regret of omission,” we refer to the observation (Table 5) that median values of regret of omission were significantly higher for the two clinical cases where surgery can be considered reasonably applicable (P< 0.05). Table 4 reports the results of clinical decision making according to regret DCA; thus, as stated in the article, we confirm that virtually all physicians can act according to the regret DCA model given that, as outlined by Spacek and Solga, this approach can lead to similar decisions regarding which treatment to adopt. The visual analog scale (VAS) has long been used in medicine for assessment of patients’ emotions, such as distress, pain, and so on. When applying DVAS, we proposed to physicians a continuous range of values ranging from 0 (no regret) to 100 (maximum regret). We feel that there should be no reason to think that clinicians may have a different zero reference value, given that it was clearly explained in Fig. 1 that zero refers to the absence of regret. Finally, physicians involved in the survey had long expertise in the field of HCC. It is obvious that the final response of each of the 40 physicians involved was the end result of personal experience, feeling, intuition, as well as logical analysis and agreement with guidelines recommendations. This is what regretbased DVAS was designed to asses: holistic evaluation of pros and cons of alternative strategies. In conducting the survey, we only sent the three clinical vignettes described in the Method section and the DVAS depicted in Fig. 1. We did not show the regret DCA model. Both vignettes and DVAS were related to the case, and not to the model itself. Thus, Spacek and Solga’s observation regarding a possible influence by the attitude conveyed by our language in the article to the model is not supported. In addition, because holistic characteristics of regret DCA includes both emotional (as weighted through regret elicitation of DVAS survey) and analytical (as analyzed through Cox’s regression model) aspects, we believe that type 1 and 2 cognitive aspects of decision making were fulfilled. In conclusion, current available surgical and nonsurgical literature suggests that, in clinical practice, there is a considerable disagreement regarding surgery for intermediate HCC, and that a multidisciplinary approach, and regret-based approach, can help physicians select the most optimal treatment for each patient.",

The \" radical transformation \" that higher education accomplishes transforms one's mind from a passive receptacle to an active participant in the process of deliberation.

Critical inquiry enables one to distinguish between fact and fiction, the pivotal skill required of any participant in the democratic process.

As was pointed out in Part 1, IC engines are among the most efficient power generation devices known to man. Indeed, IC engine efficiency can be comparable to that of advanced electricity power generation plants. In particular, diesel engine thermal efficiencies exceed 50% for large marine engines, and advanced low temperature combustion concepts have been demonstrated that provide similar or even higher efficiencies in both lightand heavy-duty engines. The high efficiency of compression ignition engines explains why they are widely used commercially, especially for heavy-duty applications and transportation. However, measures introduced to meet emissions mandates tend to reduce fuel efficiencies and also to increase engine expense. Thus, it is of much interest to explore new concepts and advanced combustion systems. The papers in this special issue describe new concepts, including hybrid technologies optimized for practical drive cycles. In addition, fuel effects, use of high compression ratios, optimized exhaust valve timings, partially premixed combustion, and dual fuel – diesel and gasoline – RCCI (reactivity controlled compression ignition) strategies are explored. As can be seen from these papers, even after being in existence for more than a century, the internal combustion engine still has considerable potential for improvement. Indeed, the technologies described in Part 2 of the special issue on fuel efficiency demonstrate that exciting prospects for further improvement of IC engines are within reach down the road.",

Compared to TiO2 NTs electrode of PFC, the present heterojunction design not only enhances the visible light absorption but also offers the higher efficiency in degrading Rhodamine B–a model organic pollutant. The study includes an evaluation of the dual performance of the photoelectrodes as well. Under visible-light irradiation of 3 mW cm−2, the cell composed of the photoanode PANI\/TiO2 NTs and CuO\/Co3O4 NRs photocathode forms an interior bias of +0.24 V within the PFC system. This interior bias facilitated the transfer of electrons from the photoanode to photocathode across the external circuit and combined with the holes generated therein along with a simultaneous power production. In this manner, the separation of electron\/hole pair was achieved in the photoelectrodes by releasing the holes and electrons of PANI\/TiO2 NTs photoanode and CuO\/Co3O4 NRs photocathode, respectively. Using this PFC system, the degradation of Rhodamine B in aqueous media was achieved to an extent of 68.5% within a reaction duration of a four-hour period besides a simultaneous power generation of 85 μA cm−2.",

Individual PLSES parameters (education, monthly income and housing type) were quantified using questionnaires. ALSES was assessed using the Socioeconomic Disadvantage Index derived from Singapore's 2010 areal census (higher scores indicate greater disadvantage). Incident DR and VI were defined as absent at baseline but present at follow-up, while DR and VI progression were defined as a ≥1 step increase in severity category at follow-up. Modified Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the associations of PLSES and ALSES with incidence and progression of DR and VI, adjusting for relevant confounders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn multivariable models, per SD increase in ALSES score was associated with greater DR incidence (risk ratio (95% CI) 1.27 (1.13 to 1.44)), DR progression (1.10 (1.00 to 1.20)) and VI incidence (1.10 (1.04 to 1.16)), while lower PLSES variables were associated with increased DR (low income: 1.68 (1.21 to 2.34)) and VI (low income: 1.44 (1.13 to 1.83); ≤4 room housing: 2.00 (1.57 to 2.54)) incidence.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found that both PLSES and ALSES variables were independently associated with DR incidence, progression and associated vision loss in Asians.

The costs on learning, residence and the additional costs (purchase of a computer, books, payment of tutors, etc., including the corruption component) were taken into account, and lost incomes as full-time students of the university, as a rule, do not work. It was found that the average member of the Russian youth laid on higher education at least 800 thousand rubles. It is assumed that at a high level of laying on education for the recognition of high or at least average efficiency of such investments the incomes for workers with higher education should be higher.

        "tahun_terbit":2003,
        "abstrak":"INTRODUCTION\nModern medical technology (ultrasonography, intraoperative radiologic contrast methods, ERC, CT and NMR) help in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and operative procedures on bile ducts. The safe performance of these operative procedures requires good knowledge of clinical anatomy. In spite of excellent laparoscopic visualization, perioperative lesions of vascular structures or extrahepatic (especially accessory) bile ducts during laparoscopic cholecystectomy are a frequent cause of intra- and postoperative complications. Therefore, we wish to point to the potential risk of running into accessory bile ducts on dissection within or around the cystohepatic triangle, which may entail some overlooked and untreated lesions.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHOD\nAccessory bile ducts originate from the liver parenchyma and may enter a large bile duct or gallbladder at any location, or can directly enter the intestine. The accessory bile ducts encountered on cholecystectomy or bile duct procedure call for special attention. We found accessory bile ducts in 13 (0.52%) patients during the procedure of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There are three groups of 'risky' accessory bile ducts that can be encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Group I includes accessory bile ducts encountered on gallbladder removal from its support: 1) Luschka's subvesical accessory bile duct was found in six (46.1%) patients. A lesion to these ducts was intraoperatively observed in three (23.1%) patients, whereas in another three (23.1%) patients it was only detected and treated on reoperation; 2) the hepatocystic bile duct enters gallbladder directly from liver parenchyma, in the area of the gallbladder lobe. A hepatocystic accessory bile duct was identified during one (7.7%) laparoscopic cholecystectomy, when the duct lumen was observed on the gallbladder removal from the lobe, and another one (7.7%) was only identified on reoperation. Group II comprises accessory bile ducts encountered during dissection in the cystohepatic triangle, between the two hepatovesical plicae: 1) the hepatocystic accessory bile duct runs from liver parenchyma into the cystic duct within the cystohepatic triangle. Bile leak from a bile duct approaching the cystic duct immediately below the clip was observed on reoperation in one (7.7%) patient; 2) the hepatohepatic accessory bile duct drains a part of the liver and runs into the common hepatic duct within the cystohepatic triangle. During one (7.7%) dissection, another delicate bile duct originating from liver parenchyma was detected upon cystic duct clipping. Bile leak from a bile duct running into the common bile duct before entering the properly occluded cystic duct was observed on one (7.7%) reoperation; 3) anastomotic accessory bile ducts connect cystic duct with the common hepatic duct, or connect gallbladder, which has its own cystic duct, with the common hepatic duct or right hepatic duct. In our laparoscopic practice, we did not encounter this type of accessory bile ducts. Group III includes accessory bile ducts observed in the laparoscopic operative field, beyond the cystohepatic triangle, during cholecystectomy and bile duct procedures: 1) the hepatocystic accessory bile duct leaves liver parenchyma and enters the gallbladder at various sites. Stumps of two such accessory bile ducts (15.4%) were detected on reoperation. One entered the gallbladder below the cystic duct entry, and the other approached the gallbladder from above.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReoperation following laparoscopic cholecystectomy was required in 15 (0.6%) patients. In eight (53.3%) of these, the reason for reoperation was untreated lesion of accessory bile duct in eight (53.3%), other untreated minor lesions of the cystic duct in five (33.3%), and lesions of the hepatocystic duct in two (13.3%) patients. Out of the eight patients reoperated on for untreated lesion of accessory bile duct, reoperation was indicated by external biliary secretion by drain for more than 7 days in three (37.5%), and by the development of biliary peritonitis with the symptom of pain in five (62.5%) patients. Right-sided shoulder pain and elevated body temperature were recorded in two (40.0%) patients each, whereas abdominal distension with pronounced local defense and hyperbilirubinemia were observed in four (80.0%) patients each. A combination of these symptoms was present in the majority of patients. The prevalence of symptoms was consistent with literature reports. Of the eight patients reoperated on for lesions of accessory bile ducts, the lesion was managed by repeat laparoscopy procedure in five (62.5%) and by laparotomy in three (37.5%) patients. There was no mortality.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBesides technical skill and experience, good knowledge of the clinical anatomy of accessory bile ducts is required to reduce the incidence of postoperative biliary secretion. Based on our own experience, lesions to accessory bile ducts are the most common cause of postoperative complications.",

The aging phenotypes of WS is resembling to those of normal aging. To uncover the mechanism of aging, we tried to model WS by patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). WS is caused by mutations in WRN gene belonging to the RecQ DNA helicase family which plays a role in genomic stability. But some of WS phenotypes are hardly explained by genomic instability. Thus, we aimed to model WS by patient-specific iPSCs to elucidate the mechanisms. Methods and Results: We sampled T lymphocytes from a patient with WS. Then we transduced with Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC) by sendai virus, and iPSC colonies were derived.

        "tahun_terbit":1998,
        "abstrak":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\nRecently, algorithms have been developed to derive the patient dose from portal dose measurements using a liquid-filled electronic portal imaging device. These algorithms have already been validated for several phantom geometries irradiated under clinical conditions. It is the aim of the present study to investigate the applicability of a liquid-filled electronic portal imaging device in combination with these algorithms for two-dimensional midplane dose verification in clinical practice.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND METHODS\nPortal dose images were obtained during several patient treatments under routine clinical conditions. Measurements were performed to verify the midplane dose during radiotherapy of larynx cancer with 4 MV beams, breast and lung cancer with 8 MV beams and prostate cancer with both 8 and 18 MV beams. Midplane doses, determined from portal dose measurements and analyzed with our algorithms, were compared with midplane doses calculated with our three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning system (TPS).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor the larynx treatment the measured 2D midplane dose agreed within 2.0% with TPS calculations in most parts of the field. Larger differences were found in a small region below the skin due to the absence of electron equilibrium, which is not taken into account in our portal dose analysis. For breast irradiations the measured midplane dose showed a homogeneous distribution in the AP direction in the axial plane, while high dose regions were observed in the cranial and caudal part of the breast. Portal dose measurements and TPS calculations agreed within 2.5% for most of the prostate and lung irradiations. For a few of the prostate and lung treatments larger local differences were found due to differences between the actual patient anatomy and the planning CT data, e.g. as a result of variable gas filling in the rectum and anatomical changes in the lung.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPortal dose measurements with a liquid-filled electronic portal imaging device can be used to determine the 2D midplane dose for various treatment sites in clinical practice. Portal in vivo dosimetry has proven to be important in detecting changes in the patient's anatomy and its influence on the dose delivery. It is concluded that portal dosimetry is an excellent tool for accurate and independent verification of the dose in the entire (2D) midplane during patient treatment. However, a limited number of patients were involved in this study and the results are therefore preliminary. More research is needed to fully assess the clinical value of portal dose measurements.",

The estimators are evaluated in terms of bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) for different values of the spatial autoregressive coefficient, different sample sizes and different specifications of weight matrices. The simulation results show that both approaches perform better for smaller values of the spatial autoregressive coefficient and larger sample sizes. SEM tends to outperform the classical approach in term of bias but the classical model based on first-order contiguity matrix has lowest RMSE in most cases. Furthermore, SEM provides a more stable performance in terms of variations of bias and RMSE with respect to changes in the value of autoregressive coefficient, sample size and number of hotspots. It follows that compared to the classical approach, SEM does not only have favorable behavioral properties in that it straightforwardly allows inclusion of different types of spatial dependence in one model framework and of testing distance decay, but also favorable econometric properties.",

Our results are similar to those reported for stressed individuals due to physical immobilisation, but do not support the predicted enhanced erythropoiesis due to higher levels of androgens. The results for WBC numbers may also reflect that subordinate hinds must allocate a higher amount of resources to immunity as a result of injuries incurred from dominant hinds, while simultaneously facing restricted access to food sources.

If he pursues the former course the donor must relinquish all dominion over the subject matter of his benefaction. If he follows the latter he retains control but at the expense of complying with the technicalities involved in the law of wills, and at the cost of subjecting the beneficiary to the delay and inconvenience of probate. To avoid the above mentioned disadvantages donors have seized upon the device of transferring property through the medium of joint and survivorship bank accounts. The account is opened in the name of the depositor and the donee and according to the terms of the deposit is payable to either or the survivor. During his lifetime the donor uses any of the funds that he may need. Upon the depositor's death the donee withdraws the balance which he keeps for his own use free from the claims of the depositor's estate. By this technique the depositor is able to do what heretofore the law never permitted; namely, make a gift without relinquishing control of the subject matter of the benefaction. If considered in the light of the technical law of gifts the power of the donor to withdraw all of the funds invalidates the entire gift. While it is true that a testator may revoke a will during his lifetime, and while in many instances a settlor may terminate a trust, the right to revoke a gift is not accorded to the donor who makes an inter vivos gratuitous transfer of his property. There are rather obvious reasons why a donor may want to retain control of the subject matter of the gift. In the first instance he may not desire to surrender all control over the deposit because misfortune may make it necessary that he use the funds for his own maintenance, or because a change in circumstances may make it desirable that he change beneficiaries. Secondly, he may avoid disposing of all of his property by will not only because of the initial formalities but also because he cannot change the will without duplicating the formalities that he found inconvenient in the first",

Moreover, Wueest argues that the formation of a consensus within the political mainstream has left a vacuum for outsider parties such as Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain to feed on the contentiousness of economic liberalization policies.",

        "tahun_terbit":2019,
        "abstrak":"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia encompasses a wide variety of lesions with very different biological behaviours and prognoses. This umbrella term incorporates benign papillomas, intraepithelial neoplasias, and invasive carcinoma, including those with high risk histology (adenosquamous, spindle cell\/sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma). For this reason, the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer recommends limiting the term “OSSN” to clinical usage only. In this issue, Polski et al describe a retrospective case series of 41 eyes of ocular surface neoplasia that compares biopsied tumours with known depth invasion with those staged clinically without biopsies. The authors conclude that, because there were no significant differences in outcomes between invasive and non-invasive tumours, treatment (with topical therapy) can be undertaken without histological assessment and with clinical staging alone. Certainly provocative, this conclusion requires considerable further validation and research in properly designed prospective multi-institutional studies. The small sample size and smaller number of recurrences make it impossible to make meaningful clinical recommendations. In addition, there are several other weaknesses with the data presented. First, follow-up period is not defined. Patients with in situ vs invasive disease are not separately analysed; the term OSSN is used both histologically and clinically. All cases in the series had multiple structure involvement, yet it is not clear whether they represented recurrences (in which a previous biopsy was performed) or primary lesions. Regarding the value of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the clinical staging of OSSN, data presented in the current study are also limited. However, this is a promising area warranting further investigation, with a larger prospective study examining the correlation between specific OCT parameters and histopathology. While all data on this much neglected group of diseases are welcome, we caution that there are important principles of current best practice cancer care that need to be considered. Australian and international cancer guidelines increasingly promote a multidisciplinary model in which management decisions are rarely made without tissue diagnosis. There are sound reasons for this. First, amelanotic or minimally pigmented conjunctival melanoma, which is clinically indistinguishable from OSSN and estimated to occur in up to 30% of cases in some series, requires a tissue diagnosis.3–6 A number of studies have highlighted the very poor outcomes in conjunctival melanoma patients in which the diagnosis is unsuspected and the treatment is unplanned.6–8 Second, some ocular surface carcinomas are associated with more aggressive behaviour (eg, perineural invasion, multifocal disease and orbital invasion) and poorer prognosis; these include poorly differentiated and spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and sebaceous carcinoma. Such cases perform poorly in the experience of ourselves and others when the diagnosis is unsuspected, and a recurrence is eventually biopsied.6–8 In addition, there is the risk of overtreatment, when benign conditions mimicking a neoplastic process are subjected to ongoing topical drug treatment. While a conservative approach to treatment is always a goal, topical therapy, like surgery, is not without morbidity and cost to the patient. With rare exceptions such as retinoblastoma (where biopsy is potentially hazardous), it is difficult to justify bypassing biopsy in the era of precision and personalized cancer medicine, where management is increasingly based on specific biomolecular tumour pathways that require tissue sampling. A case in point is the trend we are currently seeing for the management of uveal melanoma, where tissue sampling is increasingly being undertaken to guide the management of these patients. While this does not apply to OSSN now, it may be that strategies in the future will require more, not less, intimate knowledge of tumour genomics and immune microenvironment, as has occurred for many other cancers. The understanding of the natural history of ocular surface neoplasia is evolving, and this article can be seen as a call for more international collaboration on the diagnosis, classification and outcomes of OSSN. As OSSN lesions are relatively rare, large multi-site collaborative registries are one approach to collect sufficient data for evidence-based changes to management in the absence of prospective trials. A similar approach is currently being undertaken in ocular naevi and melanoma. It is overdue that this rigour be incorporated into DOI: 10.1111\/ceo.13475",

Such patients had a traceable illness course consisting of one or more episodes alternating with complete symptom remission and no additional diagnoses of axis I disorders, mental retardation or brain organic diseases. A number of variables reported to influence the course of mood disorders were controlled for as possible confounding factorsResultsBipolar women with postpartum onset disorder had fewer excited episodes (p = 0.005) and fewer episodes of both polarities (p = 0.005) compared to non-postpartum onset subjects. No differences emerged in the rates of depressive episodes. All patients who met criteria for rapid cycling bipolar disorder (7 out of 123) were in the NPPO group. Among major depressives, PPO patients experienced fewer episodes (p = 0.016). With respect to clinical and treatment features, PPO-MDD subjects had less personality disorder comorbidity (p = 0.023) and were less likely to be on maintenance treatment compared to NPPO comparison subjects (p = 0.002)ConclusionSuch preliminary findings suggest that PPO mood disorders may be characterized by a less recurrent time course. Future research in this field should elucidate the role of comorbid personality disorders and treatment. Moreover it should clarify whether PPO disorders are also associated with a more positive outcome in terms of social functioning and quality of life.",

Three different approaches were followed to estimate thickness equivalencies for continuously reinforced concrete pavements constructed with the two coarse aggregates most commonly available in Texas: crushed limestone and siliceous river gravel. The first approach is based on the AASHTO equation for design of rigid pavements, which can also be used for jointed concrete pavements. The second and third methods rely on models developed through statistical analyses of CRCP condition survey data collected in the State of Texas. Condition survey information shows that, for similar conditions, limestone CRC pavements exhibit less distress than CRCP pavements constructed with siliceous river gravel. A similar observation was made for thickness equivalencies obtained; i.e., less slab thickness than siliceous river gravel. Findings developed herein could be used to determine approximate equivalent thicknesses for the two aggregate types considered in this study if there is no need for a detailed analysis. Additionally, by using the recommended thickness equivalencies, the contractor could have enough information to estimate costs of construction of a CRCP section when he is allowed to employ either limestone or siliceous river gravel coarse aggregate. Examples for the application of equivalent thicknesses are provided in order to facilitate the implementation of the results of the various analyses carried out in this report. (FHWA)",

        "abstrak":"The autosomal dominant myopathy facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is causally related to a short Eco RI fragment detected by probe p13E-11. This remnant fragment is the result of a deletion of an integral number of tandemly arrayed 3.3 kb repeat units (D4Z4) on 4q35. Despite intensive efforts, no transcribed sequences have been identified within this array. Previously, we have shown that these repeats on 4q35 have been exchanged for a similar highly homologous repeat locus on 10q26 in 20% of the population and that a short chromosome 10-like array on 4q35 also results in FSHD. Here, we describe the hybrid structure of some of these repeat arrays, reflecting additional sub-telomeric instability. In three healthy individuals carrying a 4-like repeat on chromosome 10 or vice versa, one repeat array was shown to consist of hybrid clusters of 4-derived and 10-derived repeat units. Moreover, employing pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis, we identified two unrelated individuals carrying deletions of a chromosomal segment (p13E-11) proximal to the repeat locus. These deletions were not associated with FSHD. In one of these cases, however, an expansion of the deletion into the repeat array was observed in one of his children suffering from FSHD. These data provide additional evidence for instability of this sub-telomeric region and suggests that the length of the repeat, and not its intrinsic properties, is crucial to FSHD. Moreover, they are in agreement with the hypothesis that FSHD is caused by a position effect in which the repeat structure influences the expression of genes nearby. Therefore, the region deleted proximal to the repeat locus in healthy individuals can be instrumental to refine the critical region for FSHD1.",

Seventy eight pools were physically monitored once every four days from June to August 2006 and have provided us with a deeper understanding on dynamics of pond community organization and how organisms cope with rapid and major physical changes. Pools were monitored for temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, water color and clarity, and presence or absence of key macrofauna. The color and clarity of pools, which we used as a proxy for phytoplankton levels, varied throughout the summer and ranged between being always opaque to always clear, or cycling between these two states. Cycling of pools is important for the macrofauna because it indicates varying conditions that organisms must contend with. Clear pools had significantly lower dissolved oxygen levels, pH values and presumably, based on water clarity, lower phytoplankton stocks, while opaque pools had higher levels of both dissolved oxygen and pH and usually very high phytoplankton levels. Diel vertical migration by Daphnia. pulex was observed in these island pools which is interesting because of the lack of vertebrate predators. Significantly higher densities of D. pulex occurred in the top 10cm during the night than day. With the absence of significant predators, physical or genetic factors must explain the observed migration to the surface at night by D. pulex.",

The age and sex associations with myocardial ECV in healthy mid-life adults are uncertain. Methods Healthy adults without any history of cardiovascular disease or treatment underwent contrast-enhanced CMR at 1.5 Tesla (Siemens MAGNETOM Avanto). T1 mapping with MOLLI was performed before and 15 min after contrast (0.15 mmol\/kg gadoterate meglumine). ECV was estimated in regions (AHA 16-segment LV model) and for the whole left ventricular (LV) myocardium (all regions). ECV was calculated as the difference in relaxation rate (R1=1\/T1) for myocardium and LV blood pool before vs. after gadolinium contrast administration, corrected for haematocrit (HCT). LV segments which were not evaluable due to artefact were excluded from analysis. Results 114 segments were assessed from 19 subjects (mean age 61 ± 12 years; 10 (53%) male). 21 (18%) segments were excluded due to blood pool artefact or signal drop-out in the pre-contrast T1 MOLLI scan. All segments were evaluable in the post-contrast T1 MOLLI scans. The remaining segments for each subject were averaged to give an overall ECV (global LV). The mean ECV for all subjects was 25.6 ± 2.9%. There was no overall segmental variation in ECV. ECV in females was higher than in males (27.6 ± 3.1% vs. 23.9 ± 1.3%; P = 0.003) The percentage difference was 14.5%. ECV was higher in septal segments in females (anteroseptal: 28.0 ± 3.3% vs. 24.2 ± 1.5%; P = 0.004; inferoseptal: 27.3 ± 3.8% vs. 23.5 ± 1.6%; P = 0.011), whereas no differences were observed for other segments (Table 1).

First, it discusses the causes and characteristics of the current proliferation of rail station area redevelopment megaprojects around the globe, revealing them to be an important subset of the new generation of megaprojects discussed in this volume. Second, it offers a detailed and timely account of recent struggles surrounding “Stuttgart 21,” a massive, hugely controversial rail station redevelopment megaproject in Southern Germany, drawing lessons from the controversy over Stuttgart 21 for urban megaprojects more generally. This study is a qualitative case study analysis that involved interviews and document analysis. The experience of “Stuttgart 21” validates previous criticisms of megaprojects regarding transparency and public accountability in decision-making, environmental challenges, and cost-overruns. The political conflicts over “Stuttgart 21” are intimately tied to fundamental disagreements over future urban development and transportation policy, the costs and benefits of multibillion Euro megaprojects, and related democratic decision-making procedures. Rail stations emerge as an important, as-of-yet underexplored subset of urban megaprojects.

Results show that the CRAY-2 allows cost-effective 2-D simulations of truly large-scale models, but only begins to be effective in 3-D for models of interest in geophysics. The large memory (256 megawords) is adequate but a speed increase of at least an order of magnitude is necessary for cost-effective 3-D. True multiprocessor capability (rather than ‘multicomputer’) provides an alternative to raw speed but involves another set of difficulties.",

        "abstrak":"The influences of water poisoning on isoprene-selective hydrogenation over δ-alumina-supported eggshell Pd catalysts were investigated by test reactions at 40 °C and 420 psig of total pressure. Both fresh and water-poisoned catalysts were characterized by fast Fourier transform infrared (FFT-IR) spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of hydrogen. The catalytic performance tests showed that water poisoning suppresses the hydrogenation of isoprene and the double-bond migration of 2-methyl-1-butene and 3-methyl-1-butene to 2-methyl-2-butene, whereas it slightly facilitates the selectivity to the formation of isopentenes. FFT-IR spectroscopy characterizing CO adsorbed on the fresh and water-poisoned catalysts indicated that the bond strength between CO and palladium was weakened by the adsorption of H2O on Pd, suggesting that the adsorbed water abstracts electrons from Pd clusters. The TPD results further indicated that the formation of β-hydride was inhibited by this water adsorption. Toget...",

Conventional BCI systems use electroencephalographic signals due to its high temporal resolution, portability, and easiness to implement, for which the filter-banked analysis works as the characterization baseline. Due to such analysis yields to highly dimensional representation spaces leading to overtrained systems, we propose to combine the multiple spectral bands into a single representation space through the maximization of the centered kernel alignment criterion. As a result, the similarity between the measured EEG data and the available label sets is maximized, with the additional benefit of enhancing the spectral interpretation of the subject performance. The proposed \\(\\upkappa \\)-FB is evaluated in the dataset IIa of the BCI competition IV for a binary classification task.

Light microscopic multiple antigen detection and in non-radioactive in situ hybridization, are discussed. In IGSS, the silver shell formed around the gold particles by an autometallographic process results in an electron-dense product with a particle size proportional to the duration of silver enhancement. Application of gold conjugates with the smallest particle size results in the highest reaction density, but electron microscopic visualization of non-amplified gold particles requires high instrumental magnification and weak tissue contrasting. Amplification of the gold particle diameters by silver precipitation can improve both the signal and, by permitting almost normal counterstaining, structural recognition. This may be of particular advantage when the antigens of interest are situated in electron-dense structures, such as dense-core granules of neuroendocrine cells, immunoglobulin deposits, or cytoskeletal filament clusters. At the light microscopic level, the dark-brown to jet-black product of IGSS contrasts well with the colors of most of the chromogens generally used in immunoenzyme techniques, and IGSS is, therefore, particularly useful in multiple immunostaining combinations. By covering the immunological sequences completely, the silver precipitate can prevent unwanted side-bindings. This offers the possibility of using two primary antibodies of the same animal species for double labeling. The principle of IGSS can be exploited to reveal gold particles adsorbed, not only to immunoglobulins, but also to protein A, lectins, RNAase or streptavidin, providing a general and more sensitive marker in affinity cytochemistry.",

This asymmetry has been explained by difficult tasks being represented more strongly and consequently requiring more inhibition prior to switching to the easier task. The present study shows that switch cost asymmetries observed in arithmetic tasks (addition vs. subtraction) do not depend on task difficulty: Switch costs of similar magnitudes were obtained when participants were presented with unsolvable pseudo-equations that did not differ in task difficulty. Further experiments showed that neither task switch costs nor switch cost asymmetries were due to perceptual factors (e.g., perceptual priming effects). These findings suggest that asymmetrical switch costs can be brought about by the association of some tasks with greater difficulty than others. Moreover, the finding that asymmetrical switch costs were observed (1) in the absence of a task switch proper and (2) without differences in task difficulty, suggests that present theories of task switch costs and switch cost asymmetries are in important ways incomplete and need to be modified.",

We compare the work and residential locations of state workers in capital and non-capital cities relative to other workers in their metropolitan areas.

        "abstrak":"Non-cancer risk assessment traditionally assumes a threshold of effect, below which there is a negligible risk of an adverse effect. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry derives health-based guidance values known as Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) as estimates of the toxicity threshold for non-carcinogens. Although the definition of an MRL, as well as EPA reference dose values (RfD and RfC), is a level that corresponds to “negligible risk,” they represent daily exposure doses or concentrations, not risks. We present a new approach to calculate the risk at exposure to specific doses for chemical mixtures, the assumption in this approach is to assign de minimis risk at the MRL. The assigned risk enables the estimation of parameters in an exponential model, providing a complete dose–response curve for each compound from the chosen point of departure to zero. We estimated parameters for 27 chemicals. The value of k, which determines the shape of the dose–response curve, was moderately insensitive to the choice of the risk at the MRL. The approach presented here allows for the calculation of a risk from a single substance or the combined risk from multiple chemical exposures in a community. The methodology is applicable from point of departure data derived from quantal data, such as data from benchmark dose analyses or from data that can be transformed into probabilities, such as lowest-observed-adverse-effect level. The individual risks are used to calculate risk ratios that can facilitate comparison and cost-benefit analyses of environmental contamination control strategies.",

Perceivers watched these videos and inferred targets’ affect while having access to only visual or auditory information, or both. EA was assessed as the correlation of perceivers’ inference and targets’ self-ratings. Results suggest that auditory, and especially verbal information, is critical to EA. Furthermore, targets’ expressivity predicted both target behavior and EA, an effect influenced by the valence of the events they discussed. Specifically, expressive targets produced more nonverbal negative cues, and higher levels of EA when perceivers could only see them discussing negative events; expressive targets also produced more positive verbal cues, and higher levels of EA when perceivers could only hear them discussing positive events.

The nucleotide sequences of S-RNase alleles from several genera have been determined, but the structure of the gene products has only been described for those from Nicotiana alata. We report on the N-glycan structures and the disulfide bonding of the S3-RNase from wild tomato (Lycopersicon peruvianum) and use this and other information to construct a model of this molecule. The S3-RNase has a single N-glycosylation site (Asn-28) to which one of three N-glycans is attached. S3-RNase has seven Cys residues; six are involved in disulfide linkages (Cys-16-Cys-21, Cys-46-Cys91, and Cys-166-Cys-177), and one has a free thiol group (Cys-150). The disulfide-bonding pattern is consistent with that observed in RNase Rh, a related RNase for which radiographic-crystallographic information is available. A molecular model of the S3-RNase shows that four of the most variable regions of the S-RNases are clustered on one surface of the molecule. This is discussed in the context of recent experiments that set out to determine the regions of the S-RNase important for recognition during the self-incompatibility response.",

Saturated FFAs, such as palmitate, are known to decrease the functionality of beta cells [1] and alter their survival [2,3]. The mechanisms of this toxicity are not completely characterized but may involve endoplasmic reticulum stress [3]. Stress induced by protein misfolding, protein retention, or protein overload in the endoplasmic reticulum results in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a physiological mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum adaptation that can lead to apoptosis if occurring for too long. This is apparently the case in pathological conditions such as diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. The UPR is controlled by three key proteins (IRE1a, ATF6, PERK) that are activated when dissociating from chaperones such as BiP or via direct activation by unfolded proteins. In case of prolonged endoplasmic reticulum stress, mechanisms leading to apoptosis are activated (recently reviewed in [4]).",

Additionally, several parameters that affect the response of the connection are modified in order to investigate and quantify their effect, resulting in seven different case studies. These parameters are the size of the bolts, the thickness of the angles and the addition of stiffener. The moment- rotation curve of each case study is constructed and the results are commented.

        "tahun_terbit":1984,
        "abstrak":"Marine and anadromous populations of Gasterosteus aculeatus tend to be morphologically uniform, whereas freshwater populations inhabit diverse environments and exhibit great morphological variability (Bell, 1976a, 1984; Wootton, 1976). Although several structures of G. aculeatus vary geographically, the lateral plates have been studied most intensively. They are modified scales that are arranged in a single row along either side of the body. Lateral plate variation includes the lateral plate trimorphism (Hagen and Gilbertson, 1972, 1973), and plate number variation within each of the morphs (Bell, 1984). The complete morph has a continuous row of plates running from the nape onto the caudle peduncle, the partial morph has an abdominal plate row separated from a plate row on the caudal peduncle by an unplated area, and the low morph has only abdominal plates. A genetic basis for lateral plate morph variation has been established (Muinzing, 1959; Hagen and Gilbertson, 1973), and the pattern of geographical variation initially was attributed to divergence in glacial refugia and postglacial secondary intergradation (Miinzing, 1963; Miller and Hubbs, 1969). This explanation has been criticized (Hagen and McPhail, 1970; Bell, 1976a), and Hagen and Moodie ( 1982) suggested an alternative model for the global distribution of lateral plate morphs. They showed that in regions with cold winters and extreme annual temperature ranges, the complete morph dominates and the low morph is virtually absent. In regions with relatively warm winters and consequent low annual temperature flux the low morph is monomorphic. All three morphs occur in intermediate climates. Lateral plate morph frequencies vary markedly over short distances among freshwater populations in regions that harbor all three morphs. Although the functional significance of lateral plate morphs is not understood, the complete morph appears to be associated with more rapidly flowing water than the low morph (Hagen, 1967; Bell, 1982). In this paper we describe spatial variation of lateral plate morphs at two scales. We describe the distribution of the plate morphs among coastal drainages throughout most of the length of California, which includes the transition from low morph monomorphism to trimorphism. Within the cooler northern half of the state, where all three morphs occur, we analyze the distribution of the lateral plate morphs in relation to environmental variation.",

Most reported having little input into decisions concerning children's postseparation living arrangements, the amount of child support they paid, and the spending of their child support payments. Many claimed to have very limited say in any parenting decisions, and little or no involvement in children's schools. Fathers' limited parental role was found to be negatively correlated with their ongoing contact and involvement with children, and positively with their reported level of interparental hostility. Many respondents viewed their marginalization as parents as an impediment to their capacity to develop meaningful relationships with their children.",

Carrots were reported to have the same disease, during dry weather, but not in wet weather. The cause of the disease in the two instances reported above was clearly S. Delphinii Welch, but the two strains differed slightly. This fact and the obvious relation of this fungus to Sclerotium Rolfsii led to a somewhat extended comparison of these two organisms, which I designate respectively as S. Del? phinii I and S. Delphinii II, with Sclerotium Rolfsii and with two strains of S. Delphinii, one an authentic culture, No. S 637 from Dr. Whetzel of Cornell, hereinafter designated merely as S.

Rolfsii here used was of the same character so far as I can judge as that which I sent to Professor Saccardo and which thus came to be the type of the species. This also is the same in character as the one that was received by Dr. Halsted from Professor Rolfs, which I personally studied and which is figured in Plant Disease Fungi, p. 438.

Of course, it takes it for granted that it is of utmost important for railway administrators to carry passengers and freight safely to their destinations. Undergoing safety procedures and developing safety systems require awareness of what is causing unsafe conditions. Generally speaking, railway accidents are caused by an unsafe act and\/or an unsafe condition. Considering that 88% of accidents are caused by unsafe acts and 10% by unsafe condition and that unsafe acts of workers are more difficult to identity and prevent than unsafe conditions. This paper aims to develop a system dynamics (SD)-based model of railway workers' mental processes that can help analyze the feedback mechanisms and the resultant dynamics regarding the railway workers ' safety attitudes and safe behaviors. Compared with the model of Mingyu Shin's, this SD model considers the environment effect, which can more comprehensively understand and analyze a railway worker's mental processes toward safe behaviors. Based on the proposed model, the effectiveness of two safety improvement policies (i.e., emotion for safe behaviors, environment quality) are examined to provide a better understanding of how to eliminate unsafe acts.",

The key idea is to estimate and remove ICI from the received signal before equalization in each iterative process. Meanwhile, ICI estimation, is achieved via time-varying channel estimation based on a piece-wise linear model where time-variations information is extracted from adjacent symbols. Moreover, PIC method is introduced to further refine the performance of channel estimation and equalization. Avoiding inversion of channel gain matrix, the proposed scheme has the best performance-complexity tradeoff compared with the existing methods. Simulation results demonstrate its good performances of ICI mitigation, bit error rate (BER), and robustness against UWAC.",

The X-ray crystal structure of form II has been determined from 2506 reflections of which 2126 gave (F greater than 2 sigma). The data up to sin theta\/lambda = 0.44A-1 (Dmin = 1.14 A) were measured with CuK alpha radiation from a sealed tube. These were supplemented up to sin theta\/lambda = 0.52 A-1 (Dmin = 0.96 A) by measurements on the same crystal using a rotating anode X-ray source. The electron density was diffuse in the ester chain and the atoms of the cholesteryl tail were found to be disordered. The tail and the chain atoms were refined by restrained least squares methods to give R = 0.087 and Rw = 0.10 for reflections with F greater than 2 sigma. Crystal forms I and II represent two standard structure types already characterized for fatty acid esters of cholesterol. In form II, the ester chain is almost fully extended as is also the case for one of the two independent molecules (A) in form I. In form II, the chains pack loosely together for most of their length. M.s. amplitudes of thermal vibration for the chain C-atoms are almost uniform along the entire chain (approximately 0.25 A2 at 295 K). In form I, the proximal part of the A chain is surrounded by rigid cholesteryl groups.

Little is known, however, about the relationship of sleep location (separate room, room-sharing, bed-sharing) with sleep outcomes in older infants (ages 6-12 months). It was expected that those who sleep in a separate room would have better parent-perceived sleep outcomes and more positive sleep health behaviors.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParents of 6236 infants (6-12 months) in the United States (US) and 3798 in an international sample (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Great Britain, and New Zealand) completed a smartphone app-based expanded version of the validated Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 37.2% of the infants in the US and 48.4% in the international sample slept in a separate room. In both samples, infants who slept in a separate room as opposed to room-sharing or bed-sharing had parent-perceived sleep outcomes and sleep-related behaviors that reflected earlier bedtimes, shorter time to fall asleep, more nighttime and total sleep, and increased sleep consolidation. They were also more likely to have a consistent bedtime routine and to fall asleep independently, as well as less likely to feed to sleep at bedtime and during the night. In addition, parents of separate room sleepers perceived bedtime to be less difficult and sleep to be better overall.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOverall, 6- to 12-month-old infants who slept in a separate room had better reported sleep outcomes and fewer parent-perceived disturbances at bedtime than infants who room-shared with their parents, as well compared to those who slept in their parents' bed.",

The model incorporates three phenomena characteristic of elastohydrodynamic lubrication: thinning of the liquid layer between sliding surfaces under a normal load (“squeeze-out”), thickening of the liquid layer due to hydrodynamic pumping, and smoothing of the elastic surfaces caused by hydrodynamic pressure gradients. Observations in soft mesothelial tissues sliding in lubricant showed variations in steady state friction with velocity, load, and lubricant viscosity. In non-steady sliding, the decay rate of frictional transients at the start of rotation varied with velocity, the amplitudes of these transients varied with the preceding periods without rotation, and frictional force varied during sinusoidal sliding. Model simulations were qualitatively similar to experimental results, supporting these mechanisms. Higher lubricant viscosity increased lubricating layer thickness and lowered friction at low speeds and increased friction at high speeds, supporting hydrodynamic pumping. We conclude that the frictional variations seen with sliding mesothelial tissues are consistent with elastohydrodynamic lubrication without contact between the sliding surfaces.",

        "abstrak":"Abstract The 1 − excitations of the three-body halo nucleus 11 Li are investigated. We use adiabatic hyperspherical expansion and solve the Faddeev equations in coordinate space. The method of complex scaling is used to compute the resonance states. The Pauli forbidden states occupied by core neutrons are excluded by constructing corresponding complex scaled phase equivalent two-body potentials. We use a recently derived neutron–core interaction consistent with known structure and reaction properties of 10 Li and 11 Li. The computed dipole excited states with J π =1\/2 + , J π =3\/2 + , and J π =5\/2 + have energies ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 MeV and widths between 0.15 and 0.65 MeV. We investigate the dependence of the complex energies of these states on the 10 Li spectrum. The finite spin-3\/2 of the core and the resulting core–neutron spin–spin interaction are important. The connection with Coulomb dissociation experiments is discussed and a need for better measurements is pointed out.",

The article is based on primary sources from federal, state, regional, and urban archives in Germany and is informed by recent developments in spatial theory in anthropology, phenomenology, historical geography, and Marxism regarding the politics of space and the spatiality of political action. It explores the social production (i.e., materiality and physicality) as well as the social construction (i.e., experience and use) of space to show how the unemployed used their intimate knowledge and experience of the Ruhr's urban environments to protest their condition, gain many of their economic de...",

        "abstrak":"In a gas-solid fluidized bed, repeated interaction and friction between particles and between particles and gas generate electrostatic charge, which affects the flow behavior of particles and the safe operation of the fluidized bed. Therefore, the measurement of charge distribution in a fluidized bed is important. However, there is limited research on the related techniques, especially measurement of electrostatic charge around bubbles in a fluidized bed. In this paper a continuous and non-intrusive measurement technique using a two-dimensional electrostatic sensor array is adopted. The sensor array consists of 4×8 electrodes. In addition, a pseudo two-dimensional fluidized bed is established and a single-jet nozzle is installed at the bottom of the bed for generating stable bubbles. The electrostatic sensor array measures the charge distribution of the fluidized bed using a charge reconstruction algorithm when the jet gas velocity ranges from 6.1 m\/s to 10.5 m\/s. Meanwhile, a high speed camera is used to acquire the images for the distribution of bubbles in the fluidized bed in order to verify the charge reconstruction method. The correlation coefficient between the shapes of the bubble measured from the electrostatic sensor array and from the high speed camera is about 0.8. Moreover, the amount of charge in the fluidized bed increases with jet gas velocity. The charge of the bubble reaches -20 nC with jet gas velocity of 10.5 m\/s. The experimental results show that the electrostatic sensor array can be used to measure the charge distribution in the fluidized bed.",

As a result, financial markets can force these countries’ sovereigns into default. In this sense member countries of a monetary union are downgraded to the status of emerging economies. This makes the monetary union fragile and vulnerable to changing market sentiments. It also makes it possible that self-fulfilling multiple equilibria arise. I analyse the implications of this fragility for the governance of the Eurozone. I conclude that the new governance structure (ESM) does not sufficiently recognise this fragility. Some of the features of the new financial assistance are likely to increase this fragility. In addition, it is also likely to rip member-countries of their ability to use the automatic stabilisers during a recession. This is surely a step backward in the long history of social progress in Europe. I suggest a different approach to deal with these problems.",

        "abstrak":"Learning a foreign language is of constant interest--to students, travelers, lifelong learners, and job seekers. The landscape of such study, once offered only through a small selection of cursory guides and complicated audio courses, has radically changed. Now students can get the basics for free online, learn in conversations with native speakers in social media communities, and have access to a rich world of print and electronic resources that are exhaustive in their coverage. Andrew Walsh, a Graduate Assistant at the Literatures and Languages Library at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a master's student in Library and Information Science there, has written a guide to help librarians, be they in large academic institutions, public libraries, or high-school libraries, develop a modern collection of resources to aid the language learner. Walsh holds a bachelor's degree in Spanish and has enjoyed studying the language since his elementary school days and thus has great experience with the tools that really help one learn. While his guide is dedicated to resources for the Spanish language, it also serves as a model for those seeking to build collections in other languages--highlighting the types of tools available and suggesting the kinds of resources that create the most useful collections. Foreign language education is in the midst of a radical transformation, fueled by a boom of new technologies and applications for learning. Today, educational institutions are including more digital and interactive media alongside textbooks and traditional resources as they recognize the value of information technology. But what is the right balance? Videos, podcasts, interactive online games and quizzes are very effective for some purposes while printed books remain far superior for others. Existing guides in this area are typically either bibliographies of print material or informal lists of online websites. Rarely does either style of guide compare the different types of tools, which makes identifying the best resources a difficult proposition. Additionally the highly commercial nature of the web makes finding quality resources through Internet searches extremely difficult, as most websites are trying to make a profit from advertisements, sales of their own products or affiliate commissions. This column recommends print textbooks, grammar books and reference books while also comparing them to newly emerging formats in an attempt to paint a more complete picture of the ways Spanish is learned today. The resources were selected based on their usefulness, scope, methods, organization and clarity. Sources that address cultural realities and regional variations are highlighted, since Spanish has such diverse dialects and varieties across Iberia and Latin America. The sources included are bilingual. Advanced learners will want to consult monolingual resources as well. Of course, many other valuable resources exist beyond those listed in this work, but my purpose is to give collection development librarians a good starting point to build a collection based upon a group of core resources for each category. A title's exclusion from this list does not signify that it is not valuable. The target learning group for this collection of resources is college-level learners of Spanish, which means that advanced high school students as well as older adults can benefit as well. A short introductory section first lists a selection of quick resources designed to provide a fast and easy start to learning Spanish. Then the bulk of the guide is organized in categories based on the type of resource. Note: All online resources were accessed on 4\/29\/11. QUICK RESOURCES FOR BEGINNING SPANISH Between online lessons, podcasts and affordable basic language textbooks, there are plenty of ways for a beginner to get a quick introduction to the Spanish language at little to no cost. A variety of organizations provide free language instruction online, with various types of lessons typically geared toward beginners. …",

Clade A was composed of only strains of C raciborskii; however, in Clade B, 3 sub-groups were found: 2 well supported sub-groups as termed B1 for R. mediterranea and B2 for R. curvata and R. brookii, and B3 for the remaining strains of C. raciborskii, thus suggesting that Cylindrospermopsis and Raphidiopsis might be congeneric. Additionally, these results also suggested that the traditionally defined C. raciborskii is paraphyletic, and Glade A and Cade B deserved some taxonomic reconsideration, either as separate genera or as separate species within the same genus.

We assessed relationships between soil N availability indices (SNAIs), yield, and total N accumulation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in a typical glacial till landscape in Saskatchewan, Canada. Soil samples were collected at 3-m intervals along a 300-m transect comprised of low (LCFS) and high catchment footslopes (HCFS), and low (LCSH) and high catchment shoulders (HCSH). Total soil N and C, organic C, mineral N, depth of A horizon, spring soil moisture, grain yield, and total plant N were measured. Soil N availability indices used in this study included: (i) cumulative N released during a 2-wk aerobic incubation (N MIN ); (ii) potentially mineralizable N estimated using a 16-wk aerobic incubation (N 0 ); (iii) NO 3 sorbed on anion-exchange membranes (NO 3AEM ); (iv) N extracted with hot KCl (N KCl ); and (v) N hydrolyzed with hot KCl (N HYDR ). Although all SNAIs were significantly correlated to yield and, with the exception of N 0 , total plant N when analyzed across the transect, typically <40% of the yield variability was explained. Forward stepwise regression revealed that most SNAIs failed to explain more variability in crop N accumulation than did basic soil properties or relative elevation. Although these results do not invalidate the use of SNAIs for soil testing purposes, it is clear that SNAIs must be combined with additional information about field scale variability for predicting fertilizer N requirements. Without this information, grid sampling as a means of assessing N requirements remains ill-advised for glacial till semiarid landscapes.",

Lithuanian agriculture has been receiving investment support under the Common Agricultural policy since 2004. Indeed, the most profitable farming types – cereal and dairy farms – saw a particularly strong increase in the investment amounts. The measure of dynamic efficiency allows one analyze the performance of businesses in regards of inter-temporal optimization of the investment behavior. This paper, therefore, looks into the trends of dynamic efficiency in Lithuanian cereal and dairy farms. The research is based on the data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network covering the period of 20042014. The analysis carried out for different farm sizes indicates that scale inefficiency is the main source of technical inefficiency for smaller farms, whether cereal, or dairy ones. Farms experienced investment spikes showed slightly lower inefficiency. These technical efficiency gains are due to improved pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. However, the latter source appeared as a more important one for the smallest farms (less than 30 ha). Received: December, 2016 1st Revision: April, 2017 Accepted: June, 2017",

Eleven male youth soccer players were tested multiple times during two 3-week periods at midpoint (3-wkmid) and at the end (3-wkend) of the first half of a German under-19 1. Bundesliga season. The levels of creatine kinase (CK), urea, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured during 3-wkmid and 3-wkend each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. In 3-wkmid the CK median was 14% higher (241 vs. 212 U\/L) compared to 3-wkend (P = 0.26, ES = 0.16). Overall, the medians of CK, urea (P = 0.59, ES = 0.08), and CRP (P = 0.56, ES = 0.10) during 3-wkmid did not differ to the values of 3-wkend. Daily coefficient of variations (CVs) ranged from 22 to 71% (CK), 17 to 37% (urea), and 9 to 164% (CRP). Individual medians ranged from 101 to 350 U\/L (CK), 23 to 50 mg\/dL (urea), and 0.6 to 1.1 mg\/L (CRP). High intra-individual variability was demonstrated by large intra-individual CVs (medians: CK 50%, urea 18%, and CRP 45%). Our data show (i) large inter-day and inter-week variability of all biomarkers, depending on the external load and (ii) considerable inter- and intra-individual parameter variations.

The accurate porosity and tensile strength characterization of a tablet design is vital for predicting its performance such as disintegration, dissolution, and drug‐release efficiency upon administration as well as ensuring its mechanical integrity. In current work, a non‐destructive contact ultrasonic approach and an associated testing procedure are presented and employed to quantify and relate the acoustically extracted mechanical properties of pharmaceutical compacts to direct porosity and tensile strength measurements. Based on a comprehensive set of experimental data, it is demonstrated how strongly the acoustic wave propagation is modulated and correlated to the tablet porosity and tensile strength of a compact made using spray‐dried lactose and microcrystalline cellulose with varying mixture ratios. The effect of mixing ratio on the porosity and tensile strength on the resulting compacts is quantified and, with the acoustic experimental data, mixing ratio is related to the compact ultrasonic characteristics. The ultrasonic techniques provide a rapid, non‐destructive means for evaluating compacts in formulation development and manufacturing. The presented approach and data could find critical applications in continuous tablet manufacturing, its real‐time quality monitoring, as well as minimizing batch‐to‐batch quality variations.",

In this paper, we present a novel planar small ultra-wideband (UWB) micro-strip fed antenna, for IR-UWB. Cluttered WSN are difficult cases for communications, implying the antenna to be adapted to the communication channel. The first consideration is the path loss compensation hypothesis. The designed antenna has a small size of 20×20×0.8mm3, and an omnidirectional radiation pattern over the frequency band considered (6-8.5 GHz). A comprehensive characterization of the antenna is done in both frequency and time domain. Thus, different path loss orders are considered and two signal pulses are used. The effect of channel path loss is discussed and the antenna transfer function is determined. Return loss and radiation pattern are depicted and completed with the isotropy factor. The gain increases with frequency, providing a quasi-constant free space transmission channel transfer function. Time domain analysis, via Fidelity factor and pulse width Stretch Ratio, is done for the both pulses and for the different path loss orders. Such Figures of Merit (FoM) are discussed in function of the path-loss order, which is a simple modelization of cluttered WSN channels (reference cases).",

The design of PID control is based on the frequency response of the dc-dc converter. Implementation of linear controllers on a digital signal processor is straightforward, but realization of fuzzy controllers increases computational burden and memory requirements. For the boost converter, the performance of the fuzzy controller was superior in some respects to that of the PID controllers. The fuzzy controller was able to achieve faster transient response in most tests, had a more stable steady-state response, and was more robust under some operating conditions.

Four flow configurations are investigated, based on straight or zigzag microchannels. Additionally to the experimental work, we performed two-dimensional numerical simulations. In the experiments, we analyze the influence of different parameters on the process (channel dimensions, fluid viscosities, flow rates, drop size, droplet spacing, ...). Several regimes are singled out. In agreement with the mass transfer theory of Young et al. (Young, W.; Pumir, A.; Pomeau, Y. Phys.

The numerical simulation is found in excellent consistency with the experiment.

The samples included: bones, eggshells and feathers of penguin Pygoscelis papua, bones and feathers of petrel Daption capense, bones and fur of seal Mirounga leonina, algae Himantothallus grandifolius, Desmarestia anceps and Cystosphaera jacquinotii, fish Notothenia corriceps, sea invertebrates Amphipoda, shells of limpet Nacella concina, lichen Usnea aurantiaco-atra, vascular plants Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis, fungi Omphalina pyxidata, moss Sanionia uncinata and soil. The results show a large variation in some activity concentrations. Samples from the marine environment had lower contamination levels than those from terrestrial ecosystems. The highest activity concentrations for all radionuclides were found in lichen and, to a lesser extent, in mosses, probably because lichens take up atmospheric pollutants and retain them. The only significant correlation (except for that expected between 238Pu and 239+240Pu) was noted for moss and lichen samples between plutonium and 90Sr. A tendency to a slow decrease with time seems to be occurring. Analyses of the activity ratios show varying fractionation between various radionuclides in different organisms. Algae were relatively more highly contaminated with plutonium and radiostrontium, and depleted with radiocesium. Feathers had the lowest plutonium concentrations. Radiostrontium and, to a lesser extent, Pu accumulated in bones. The present low intensity of fallout in Antarctic has a lower 238Pu\/239+240Pu activity ratio than that expected for global fallout.",

        "abstrak":"This thesis assumes that carpooling is an underutilized mobility measure that aims travel reduction. Policies to encourage carpooling, including the adoption of carpooling systems, are of great value to minimize amount of cars circulating. However, efficient policies depend on understanding the behavioural patterns that surround carpooling supply and demand. In this context, university campuses are attractive object of study due to their configuration as important trips generating developments in the urban composition, especially when the public transportation system is unsatisfactory. Therefore, this dissertation aims to investigate the factors influencing carpooling supply by students from Campus Joaquim Amazonas (CJA – Recife), Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. In addition, some efficient measures for carpooling expansion are identified and suggested. The relevant criteria are investigated for two situations: i) adoption of casual carpooling; ii) entrance in a hypothetical dynamic carpooling system, a tool that provides immediate connection between unknown persons having similar travel needs, based on smartphones and geolocation technology. This study’s relevance is justified by the greater increase of car fleet in Recife’s Metropolitan Region, in addition to the low level of vehicles occupancy in CJA (1.57 persons\/vehicle, considering only students) which may be raised. To carry out this research, the data has been collected through a questionnaire answered by students who usually drive to the university, that is, the possible carpooling suppliers, considering that without them an existing demand cannot be met. The information gathered is analysed by Logistic Regression, which makes it possible to identify the strength of each criterion evaluated over the probability of carpooling supply success. The results show that, for a casual ride, the fixed factors (social demographic and travel) are more impacting in the supply decision. On the other hand, changeable factors that are inherent to the carpooling arrangement and psychological factors are more related to the dynamic mode. The hypothesis that the carpooling use can be raised by the adoption of carpooling systems witch break some barriers of this transportation mode is confirmed. In spite of the great variability of factors that motivate the adoption of alternative travel modes, it is concluded that, along the trips connection systems, it is important to assume informative and educational policies in order to encourage changes in travel behaviour and promote carpooling. This way, the reasons that do not motivate this transport mode, such as the reduction of flexibility, may turn less important over this mode choice decision. Beyond this, it is fundamental that the campuses implement a global Institutional Policy of Sustainable Mobility.",

Results indicate migration of the proton toward the center of the hydrogen bond as temperature is increased, in line with recent experimental measurements.

An analysis of existing neutron diffraction data leads us to conclude that the effective potential well experienced by the proton is temperature-dependent. Inspired by our computations and theoretical analysis, we offer a possible explanation for the proton migration phenomenon.",

        "abstrak":"Abstract Multivariate statistical methods and inverse geochemical modeling were jointly used to define the variation and the genetic origin of chemical parameters of groundwater in the Ain Azel plain, Algeria. Interpretation of analytical data shows that the abundance of the major ions is as follows: Ca ≥ Mg > Na > K and HCO 3  ≥ Cl > SO 4 . Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was employed for partitioning the water samples into hydrochemical facies, also known as water groups or water types. Three major water groups resulted from the HCA analysis. The samples from the area were classified as recharge area waters (Group 1: Ca–Mg–HCO 3 water), transition zone waters (Group 2: Ca–Mg–Cl–HCO 3 water), and discharge area waters (Group 3: Mg–Ca–HCO 3 –Cl water). Inverse geochemical models of the statistical groups were developed using PHREEQC to elucidate the chemical reactions controlling water chemistry. The inverse geochemical modeling demonstrated that relatively few phases are required to derive water chemistry in the area. In a broad sense, the reactions responsible for the hydrochemical evolution in the area fall into three categories: (1) dissolution of evaporite minerals; (2) precipitation of carbonate minerals; and (3) weathering reactions of silicate minerals.",

In the experiments, the diffusion of implanted boron was shown to depend on both the implantation dose and the annealing conditions. For lower-dose implantation (2*1015 cm-2), a 900 degrees C\/30 minfurnace annealing produced larger diffusion than 15 s rapid thermal annealing. However, in the higher dose case (6*1015 cm-2, the extent of diffusion for these two annealing conditions was reversed. In the case of two-step annealing, there was minimal diffusion observed both for the low-dose and the high-dose cases. In this work, we have related the DED of boron atoms to the excess self-interstitials, which generate mobile boron at the interstitial sites through the kickout mechanism. Both local relaxation and diffusion of self-interstitials are considered. The basic feature of the DED reported by Powell has been successfully reproduced and explained.",

Both these aspects of learning actively engage students in their own construction of understanding and are particularly relevant in physics education where many of the concepts are abstract and are generally found to be difficult. This paper investigates the extent to which physics teachers in Vietnam integrate practical work and context-based approaches into their teaching, and explores the how, what, and why they do it. The findings indicate that the Vietnamese teachers value the benefits of both practical work and contextual approaches to teaching and learning physics, but the environment that they are in does not provide sufficient opportunities to implement these methods of teaching.",

Color measurement using the CIELAB coordinate system was employed to quantify the degree of staining left by different molding compounds on a standard terracotta substrate. The total color shift as recorded in this coordinate system was found to relate to the viscosity and set time of the silicone rubber used, and all of the silicone rubbers tested were found to stain to some extent.

It turns out such systems can be made to exhibit bosonic or fermionic behaviour depending on how strongly correlated they are, as measured by the amount of entanglement these fermion pairs contain.

RAGE upregulation has been described in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease and Huntington's disease (HD). To analyze in detail the implication of RAGE in HD, we studied the immunohistochemical distribution of RAGE in the striatum of the R6\/2 mouse model of HD, with particular attention to the neuronal subpopulations and their relative vulnerability to HD neurodegeneration. We show that RAGE immunoreactivity is evenly distributed to the cytoplasm of neurons in the wild type mouse, while it is finely granular in the cytoplasm of striatal neurons of R6\/2 mouse. RAGE is distributed in 98% of spiny projection neurons, both in the normal mouse and in the R6\/2. RAGE co-localizes with all of the striatal interneuron subsets both in the wild-type and in the R6\/2 mouse. However, the intensity of RAGE immunoreactivity is significantly higher in the spiny neurons and in the PARV neurons of R6\/2 mouse, whereas it is comparable between R6\/2 and wild-type in the cholinergic and somatostatinergic interneurons. These data support the concept that RAGE is upregulated in the neurodegenerative process of HD, and suggests that its activation is related to the individual vulnerability of the striatal neuronal subtype.",

These transcripts initiate upstream of the switch alpha 1 and switch alpha 2 regions and contain, together with the C alpha 1 and C alpha 2 sequences, additional exons designated according to the generally accepted nomenclature I alpha 1 and I alpha 2 respectively. The I alpha exons are spliced directly onto the acceptor splice site of the CH1 domains of the C alpha 1 and C alpha 2 genes. As in other previously characterized germ-line transcripts, stop codons present in all three reading frames prevent translation of the C alpha 1 and C alpha 2 heavy-chain coding sequences. The longest open reading frame (ORF) present in the I exons can code for a polypeptide of only 26 amino acids. The human I alpha exons do not show any significant sequence homology with the corresponding mouse I alpha exon. However, comparison of nucleotide sequences of the genomic mouse and human I alpha regions demonstrated the presence of an approximately 300 bp highly conserved element located immediately upstream of the transcription initiation sites of the human and mouse C alpha germ-line transcripts. The isolation of the C alpha 1 and C alpha 2 germ-line transcripts will further facilitate the characterization of the molecular events responsible for the regulation of the human C alpha heavy chain loci.",

Fish were injected with live bacteria, and 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after inoculation, samples were collected after perfusion fixation. Morphologically, the most prominent change in the course of the experiment was an increasing number of intrasinusoidal, endothelial cell-adherent phagocytes and the elevated number of interstitial melanomacrophages. Immunohistochemically, bacterial antigens were initially identified in intrasinusoidal phagocytes, and at 24 hours postinfection in endothelium-adherent phagocytes and intrasinusoidal melanomacrophages. Later, (48 and 72 hours postinfection), the interstitial melanomacrophages were also found to harbor bacterial antigen. Ultrastructurally, bacteria were identified in phagosomes in intrasinusoidal phagocytes, and morphological findings also indicated an increased cellular degradation, including autophagocytosis. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that bacterial antigens were associated with melanomacrophages, specifically in their electron-dense cytoplasmic granules. These findings indicate that intrasinusoidal phagocytes and melanomacrophages participate in the rapid and active clearance of particulate material from the circulation, i.e., pathogenic microorganisms, and in the scavenging of cellular degradation products.

An unbiased selection of suitable Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model scenarios provides the basis for this analysis. A total of 61 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) with 609 emission scenarios are considered. Samples are drawn from the selected multi-model ensemble and provide projections of the rate-of-change between current and future IDFs as predicted by the selected climate models and individual scenarios. A bootstrap analysis of the current period (2010–2039) is carried out and compared with historical data.

Only the lower 68% confidence intervals show a decreased rainfall. The upper 68% confidence intervals (approximately 66% of the 84-percentile value) from the climate change analysis are adopted to predict the future design rainfall providing a reasonable degree of safety for design of infrastructure with long design horizon. The results indicate an increase of up to 50% for the 100-year rainfall event from current to the intermediate scenario (2040–2069).

It was found that in addition to the catabolic effects, i.e. inhibition of the protein synthesis and\/or stimulation of their breakdown the hormone also exhibited an \"anticatabolic\" effect that manifested itself in an inhibition of the protein breakdown. This effect was observed in all the cases (except the white functioning muscle) simultaneously with the protein synthesis inhibition, thus counteracting to this or that degree the development of atrophic reactions in the muscles.",

Materials and methods: We reviewed 38 cases of vertebral metastasis (1995–2004) from primary tumours: lung 21%, breast 21%, prostate 12%, renal 12%, ovary 8%, tongue 4%, cavum 4%, melanoma 4%, unknown primary tumour 17%. 24 cases were treated surgically in terms of the clinical criterion agreed between oncologist and traumatologist. We reviewed the follow-up of the cases (treatment, complications, mortality) and the subsequent application of the Tokuhashi prognostic index and the Tomita therapy protocol with two objectives: to evaluate our results and assess these two methods as working tools. Results: 74% of the patients had preoperative radiotherapy. The surgical treatment was corporectomy and dorsal decompression (17%), partial corporectomy and dorsal decompression (29%), decompression and dorsal instrumentation (37%) and non-instrumented decompression laminectomy (17%). The mean survival was 17 months. The surgical treatment controlled pain in 87%; there was neurological improvement in 21%, control in 54% and progression in 25%. Conclusions: Our results were not as good as those found in the literature, in which the usefulness of postoperative radiotherapy is emphasised. Preoperative radiotherapy may have made tumour excision more difficult which, together with the delayed decision-making, influenced the loss of efficacy in our cases. We need more prospective studies to validate the Tokuhashi index and the Tomita protocol, which we think are very useful in taking therapy decisions.",

        "abstrak":"Abstract. The fraction of gasoline direct-injection (GDI) vehicles\ncomprising the total vehicle pool is projected to increase in the future.\nHowever, thorough knowledge about the influence of GDI engines on important\natmospheric chemistry processes is missing – namely, their contribution to\nsecondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursor emissions, contribution to SOA formation, and\npotential role in biogenic–anthropogenic interactions. The objectives of\nthis study were to (1) characterize emissions from modern GDI vehicles and\ninvestigate their role in SOA formation chemistry and (2) investigate\nbiogenic–anthropogenic interactions related to SOA formation from a mixture\nof GDI-vehicle emissions and a model biogenic compound, α -pinene.\nSpecifically, we studied SOA formation from modern GDI-vehicle emissions\nduring the constant-load driving. In this study we show that SOA formation\nfrom GDI-vehicle emissions was observed in each experiment. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured\nwith the proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight\nmass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) could account for 19 %–42 % of total SOA mass generated in each experiment. This suggests that there were lower-volatility\nintermediate VOCs (IVOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in the GDI-vehicle exhaust that likely contributed to SOA production but were not detected with the\ninstrumentation used in this study. This study also demonstrates that two distinct mechanisms caused by anthropogenic emissions suppress α -pinene SOA mass yield. The first suppressing effect was the presence of NOx . This mechanism is consistent with previous reports demonstrating suppression of biogenic SOA formation in the presence of anthropogenic emissions. Our results indicate a possible second suppressing effect, and we suggest that the presence of anthropogenic gas-phase species may have suppressed biogenic SOA formation by alterations to the gas-phase chemistry of α -pinene. This hypothesized change in oxidation pathways led to the formation of α -pinene oxidation products that most likely did not have vapor pressures low enough to partition into the particle phase. Overall, the presence of gasoline-vehicle exhaust caused a more than 50 % suppression in α -pinene SOA mass yield compared to the α -pinene SOA mass yield measured in the absence of any anthropogenic influence.",

Both enzymes were reported recently to participate in piRNA biogenesis in silkworm and C. elegans, respectively. To get insights on the role of mammalian PNLDC1, we characterized the human and mouse enzymes. PNLDC1 shows limited conservation compared to PARN and represents an evolutionary related but distinct group of enzymes. It is expressed specifically in mouse embryonic stem cells, human and mouse testes and during early mouse embryo development, while it fades during differentiation. Its expression in differentiated cells, is suppressed through methylation of its promoter by the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3B. Both enzymes are localized mainly in the ER and exhibit in vitro specificity restricted solely to 3′ RNA or DNA polyadenylates. Knockdown of Pnldc1 in mESCs and subsequent NGS analysis showed that although the expression of the remaining deadenylases remains unaffected, it affects genes involved mainly in reprogramming, cell cycle and translational regulation. Mammalian PNLDC1 is a novel deadenylase expressed specifically in cell types which share regulatory mechanisms required for multipotency maintenance. Moreover, it could be involved both in posttranscriptional regulation through deadenylation and genome surveillance during early development.",

This one microglomerulus contains the axons of 19 retinular cells, which pass by without contacts; 13 efferent fibres with 44 synapses to and from eccentric cell collaterals; and arborizations from 54 eccentric cells with 577 synapses. Eccentric cell axons are devoid of synaptic input. Their collaterals ramify in synaptic knots and subserve both pre- and postsynaptic functions simultaneously. Arborizations near the axon of origin have a highly branched pattern (up to 20 bifurcations), a high synaptic input:output ratio (up to about 9:1), and high synaptic density (a maximum of 12 per micrometre of neurite length). The opposite extreme is represented by sparsely branched eccentric cell collaterals distant from their axons of origin with very little synaptic input and sparse output. Spatially graded lateral inhibition is the apparent outcome of a radially decreasing distribution of inhibitory synapses on the arborizations of eccentric cell collaterals combined with possible decremental signal transmission in the plexus. The synaptic analysis has a bearing on most physiological aspects of lateral inhibition that have been studied in the Limulus eye. Implied in the results is the suggestion that synapse formation is an intrinsic property of the presynaptic element, but that the connectivity is governed by the electrical activity of target neurons.",

        "tahun_terbit":2005,
        "abstrak":"Every year millions of people die of diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis for which a cure has existed for decades. This gap — between knowledge and practice in public health — is at the heart of WHO-sponsored proposals to be considered this month by WHO’s Executive Board. The proposals, known as the Mexico Statement, call on governments, foundations and other bodies that fund research as well as the international research community to strengthen malfunctioning health systems by promoting more research into those systems. Unlike previous research initiatives, the Mexico Statement calls specifically for more attention to be paid to research into health systems, for better ethical management of such research and better translation of these findings into public health practice. “Research”, the Mexico Statement says, “has a crucial but under-recognized part to play in strengthening health systems, improving the equitable distribution of high-quality health services, and advancing human development”. If the Statement wins Executive Board backing at a meeting in Geneva from 19 to 24 January, the World Health Assembly in May will consider adopting a WHO resolution that would commit signatory states more closely to the proposals. The Mexico Statement was presented at a Ministerial Summit on Health Research in Mexico City, where 22 health ministers and other officials from 51 countries gathered from 16–20 November. Its goal is to tackle obstacles preventing lowand middle-income countries from achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In a 12-point action plan intended to transform the way research is done and how its findings are disseminated, the Statement calls on governments to make research into health systems a priority; to give people in developing countries better access to knowledge and to base health policy decisions on scientific evidence. It proposes establishing an international clinical trials register as one way of achieving these goals. Although ministers agreed to “fund the necessary health research to ensure vibrant health systems and reduce inequity and social injustice,” their final statement stopped short of its original more concrete recommendation that developing countries should spend 2% of national health expenditures on health research. A recommendation that development agencies allocate 5% of their health-sector financing for the same purpose ended up as a footnote. There were no specific proposals for industrial nations’ contributions. Dr Tikki Pang, Director of Research Policy and Cooperation in WHO’s Evidence and Information for Policy cluster, said the Mexico Statement was vital because research into health systems tended to be neglected and under-funded in comparison with the field of biomedical research. “Progress will only occur if countries show commitment and support for a spectrum of activities which will help to bring research into health system activities into the mainstream,” Pang told the Bulletin. The Statement won backing from officials attending the summit — a follow-up to a conference on health research in Bangkok in 2000 — but some delegates said it was too vague. Dr Elias A. Zerhouni, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, said translating knowledge into action was key but that the effective application of this knowledge was different in each specific context or local situation. “The connection between policymakers, leaders and evidence-based intervention needs to be strengthened by research,” Zerhouni told the Bulletin before speaking at the Summit opening plenary session. “What we’ve also come to realize is that there isn’t really a health research solution that is global in nature. Health systems are very local. What is effective in one system may not be effective in another.” If that is not taken into account, Zerhouni said, “what you have is a full disconnect between political leadership, policy-makers and deployment of health resources”. Dr Lincoln C. Chen, Director of the Global Equity Initiative at the Asia Center of Harvard University and head of the Commission on Health Research for Development — the 1990 precursor to current efforts — said the proposals were not concrete enough. Chen said that the past 14 years had seen a “huge revolution in developing countries coming up with research systems” but that he “would like to see something a little bit more specific”. WHO officials said the aim of the summit was to develop programmes and a methodology in four crucial public health areas: finance, workforce management, generating knowledge and managing supplies. WHO’s Pang argued that there were simple, cost-effective ways of making great strides for public health and cited the example of a district in the United Republic of Tanzania where child mortality was recently reduced by 46% after local officials re-directed part of their US$ 2 per capita annual health budget into research to isolate the causes of child death and to addressing the underlying cause of the problem. “It seems so obvious, and yet if you survey the literature it’s very clear that very little attention is being given to this,” Pang said, referring to health systems research, adding that since this involves human behaviour, society, economics, education and poverty: “It’s just a very complicated area”. Dr Ariel Pablos-Méndez, Director of WHO’s Knowledge Management and Sharing department, said the Mexico meeting underscored the need for a culture of knowledge translation and effective problem solving, new professional capabilities and different incentives in research systems in public health. Pablos-Méndez said: “The Mexico Summit marks a shift in focus most timely and appropriate for the millions of poor people left behind, and offers a vision and a challenge to the international research community and national governments”. O Theresa Braine, Mexico City The connection between policy-makers, leaders and evidencebased intervention needs to be strengthened by research ... what we’ve also come to realize is that there isn’t really a health research solution that is global in nature.

Indeed, our sense of time depends on intrinsic context, such as the emotional state, and on extrinsic context, such as the rhythm of others' activity. Existing studies on the relationships between emotion and time suggest that these contextual variations in subjective time do not result from the incorrect functioning of the internal clock but rather from the excellent ability of the internal clock to adapt to events in one's environment. Finally, the fact that we live and move in time and that everything, every act, takes more or less time has often been neglected. Thus, there is no unique, homogeneous time but instead multiple experiences of time. Our subjective temporal distortions directly reflect the way our brain and body adapt to these multiple time scales.",

Both quasi-static and dynamic ultrasonic measurements of the elastic modulus were found to decrease by 60 pct, and the critical value of the stress intensity factors was found to increase by approximately 45 pct for the rubber epoxy composites. This was also confirmed with the finite element analysis that had the same increasing trend. The fracture surface morphology reveals rough cleavage fracture in the epoxy matrix with brittle intergranular decohesion caused by the impurity segregation that exhibits relatively high micro-roughness of the fracture surfaces.",

        "abstrak":"Abstract Trifolium (red clover) belongs to Fabaceae family, is a legume, and has long been provided noteworthy contributions to agricultural and animal production in all over the world. T. pratense L. has seven diploid (2n = 2x = 14) varieties, a natural source of valuable isoflavonoids, some of which are available commercially worldwide. The tetraploid T. pratense L., which is obtained by classical hybridization methods, is an important forage plant in Asia, Europe, America, New Zealand, and Australia. Another tetraploid (2n = 4x = 28) variety, called “Hungarypoli” in Hungary and Elci red clover in Turkey and superior to diploid varieties, is being cultivated currently. The plant is used not just for animal feeding but also for medicinal purposes. Tea made from flowers, or tinctures, has been used for upper respiratory disturbances and as a mild sedative, antispasmodic, and cure for rheumatism. Besides isoflavonoids, T. pratense contains flavonoids, coumarin derivatives, cyanogenic glycosides, volatile oil, saponins, trace vitamins, and minerals. Major isoflavonoids are biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, and geinstein, which have estrogenic activities. It has therefore been used to ease menopausal symptoms, for the maintenance of the cardiovascular system and improvement of bone health, furthermore, for its beneficial effects in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Moreover, limited studies on the seed extract of T. pratense have indicated the presence of the flavonoid compounds quercetin, taxifolin, taxifolin-O-hexos derivatives, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, and other phenolic compounds, some of which have previously been revealed in aerial parts of the plant. The high concentration of quercetin and the presence of soyasapogenol B glycosides make the seeds of some Trifolium species a promising plant material to be used in human nutrition as nutraceuticals or food additives. Utilization of red clover should be avoided in patients taking hormonal medications, since the phytochemicals in red clover and hormones will compete for the same hormonal receptor sites, which might interfere with the medication, leading to unpredictable consequences. In this chapter, we will first give botanical description, historical cultivation, present-day cultivation, and usage of Trifolium and applications of the plant\/seed\/extract\/semi-purified isoflavonoids for their health promotion and disease prevention. Later on clinical studies involving the application of red clover dietary supplements, moreover caution, drug interactions adverse effects, allergies and toxicity will be discussed.",

In this study, we examined metabolic changes in rats in the acute stage after trauma. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of a very early decompression craniotomy on intracranial pressure (ICP) and on metabolic parameters. For this study, a moderate controlled cortical impact injury (CCII) on rats was performed. The observation time was 180 minutes after trauma. ICP was measured continuously and microdialysate samples were collected every 30 minutes from the peri-contusional region. As representative metabolic parameters, glutamate, lactate, lactate\/pyruvate ratio (L\/P ratio), and glucose concentrations were measured. Compared to sham-operated animals, a significant, sustained decrease in glucose concentration and increase in L\/P ratio occurred immediately after CCII. Additionally, delayed increase in lactate and glutamate concentrations occurred 60 minutes after trauma. After this initial peak, glutamate concentrations declined continuously via the observation time and reached levels comparable to sham-operated animals. In our model, thus we could detect a very early deterioration of glucose utilization and energy supply after trauma that recovered, due to the moderate intensity of the trauma, within 60 minutes without leading to ischemia in the peri-contusional region. Following decompression craniotomy, the increase of intracranial pressure could be reduced significantly. Any significant beneficial effects on metabolic changes, however, could not be proven in this very early stage after moderate CCII.",

        "tahun_terbit":2002,
        "abstrak":"The recent popularity of voice over IP (VoIP) services in the Internet world lies in the fact that in VoIP, voice packets are carried over the shared packet-switched network (the Internet) rather than on dedicated circuit-switched telephony network. This phenomenon reduces the cost of carrying the voice packets substantially. We propose that the concept of VoIP over wireless GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) also reduces the complexity of the GSM\/GPRS architecture. Currently, the existing GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) network carries the voice packets in the air link and converts it to circuit-switched PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) signal by using the voice transcoder. A 64 Kbps circuit-switched connection is then established through the existing PSTN (Public Switch Telephone Network). Wireless data packets on the other hand, share the same physical air link, but are carried through the GPRS packet-switched network. If we carry the voice on the same packet-switched network rather than on a separate circuit-switched network, then integration of data and voice would alleviate the necessity of circuit-switched components. However, maintaining the voice quality offers significant challenges. In this paper we propose a method of implementing the VoIP in GPRS network using H.323 protocol, and also identify the additional architecture requirements that will address some of the performance impediments of current GPRS VoIP implementation. The performance results for control message signals demonstrate the possibility of maintaining call set-up delay within the current delay standards. Analytical modeling of the voice traffic shows that significant improvements in terms of voice traffic capacity is possible with the help of a silent-detection scheme.",

A compactness theorem has been proved. This generalizes slightly an earlier result proved by the second author. Introduction. A continuous mapping f: X1 -X2 between two topological spaces is called proper if f1 (K) C X1 is compact whenever K C X2 is compact. Proper holomorphic mappings between analytic spaces stand out for their beauty and simplicity. For instance, if g: D1 -+ D2 is a proper holomorphic mapping between two bounded domains in C', a theorem of Remmert says that (DIg 9, D2) is a finite branching cover. The branching locus in D1 is described by {z E D1 I det(dg(z)) = 0}. For the past ten years, there has been a great amount of activity in characterizing the proper holomorphic mappings between pseudoconvex domains. It has been known for a long time that there are numerous proper holomorphic maps between unit disks in C1. The simplest example is g: i = {z E C1 I IzI 2. Suppose f: Bn -Bn is a proper holomorphic mapping. Then f must be a biholomorphism. The following result due to S. Pin6uk is an extension of Alexander's theorem. THEOREM 2 [5]. Let D1 and D2 be two strongly pseudoconvex bounded domains with smooth boundaries in Cn, n > 2. Suppose f: D1 -D2 is a proper holomorphic mapping. Then f is a covering. In [7] the second author proved the following result concerning biholomorphic groups of strongly pseudoconvex domains. THEOREM 3 [7]. Let D be a strongly pseudoconvex bounded domain with smooth boundary in Cn. Then Aut(D) is noncompact if D is biholomorphic to Bn, n = dimc D.

The effect of PGD2 on the formation of inositol phosphates (EC50 was 20 nM) was more potent than that on the formation of choline (EC50 was 0.5 microM). The formation of choline stimulated by a combination of PGD2 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C, was additive. Staurosporine, an inhibitor for protein kinases, enhanced the PGD2-induced formation of choline, but H-7, another inhibitor for protein kinases, had little effect. PGD2 stimulated Ca2+ influx from extracellular space dose-dependently. The depletion of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA reduced the PGD2-induced formation of choline. W-7 and trifluoperazine dihydrochloride, antagonists of calmodulin, dose-dependently inhibited the PGD2-induced choline formation. These results strongly suggest that PGD2 activates phospholipase D in a Ca2+\/calmodulin dependent manner in osteoblast-like cells, and that protein kinase C is not essential for the PGD2-induced activation of phospholipase D.",

Instruction and error correction play no role in the development of competence in the L2. This article reports the long-term results of a study investigating the role of primary linguistic data in the acquisition of linguistic competence - in par ticular, the rules of adverb placement in English. This study examines the knowledge of adverb placement of 52 grade-6 francophone students (aver age age: 12 years, 2 months) learning English as a second language (ESL) in Québec schools. A year earlier, these subjects had been exposed over a two- week period to a flood of primary linguistic data on adverb placement in English. Immediately after the input flood, it was found that while the sub jects had learnt which adverb positions were grammatical in English, they still used positions which were ungrammatical in English but grammatical in the L1. The results of the follow-up test reported in this article reveal that one year after the input flood, the subjects' knowledge of adverb placement has not changed. They still use both the grammatical and the ungrammatical adverb positions, indicating that exposure to an abundance of primary lin guistic data on adverb placement did not lead to mastery of this structure. Possible explanations for these results and their implications for the L1 = L2 position are discussed.",

Furthermore, employers, institutes and universities also emphasise that an individual apt at communication skills is more likely to get a job in comparison to one who is not. This study is meant to decipher the communication skills of management trainees at the time of joining the institute through a self-appraisal questionnaire. The research design employed was Descriptive Cross-Sectional. 125 students were chosen from five management institutes in Lucknow(India) by employing non-random Convenience Sampling. Findings indicated that there is an overall fear of public speaking,respondents fall short of words while writing in Englishand need to be encouraged to read more English magazines and novels.Conclusively, a curriculum may be designed wherein the faculty, along with inputs of the students can build a framework with a view to maximising public speaking activities, and other activities may focus upon reading and writing. Moreover, peer-feedback is recommended to enhance reflective learning.

        "abstrak":"[1] Subglacial water in continental Antarctica forms by melting of basal ice due to geothermal or frictional heating. Subglacial networks transport the water from melting areas and can facilitate sliding by the ice sheet over its bed. Subglacial water flow is driven mainly by gradients in overburden pressure and bed elevation. We identify small (median 850 m) water bodies within the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in East Antarctica organized into long (20–103 km) coherent drainage networks using a dense (5 km) grid of airborne radar data. The individual water bodies are smaller on average than the water bodies contained in existing inventories of Antarctic subglacial water and most are smaller than the mean ice thickness of 2.5 km, reflecting a focusing of basal water by rugged topography. The water system in the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains reoccupies a system of alpine overdeepenings created by valley glaciers in the early growth phase of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. The networks follow valley floors either uphill or downhill depending on the gradient of the ice sheet surface. In cases where the networks follow valley floors uphill they terminate in or near plumes of freeze-on ice, indicating source to sink transport within the basal hydrologic system. Because the ice surface determines drainage direction within the bed-constrained network, the system is bed-routed but surface-directed. Along-flow variability in the structure of the freeze-on plumes suggests variability in the networks on long (10s of ka) timescales, possibly indicating changes in the basal thermal state.",

They influence the migration and homeostasis of naive T cells; however, their influence on activated T cells remains undescribed. We have recently identified that FRCs and LECs inhibited T cell proliferation through regulated nitric oxide synthase-2(NOS2)-dependent mechanism. Importantly, in vivo NOS2 expression by FRCs and LECs controlled the size of the activated T cell pool. Mechanistically, the expression of NOS2 and production of nitric oxide (NO) paralleled the activation of T cells and required IFNGR1 signaling in FRCs and LECs, and was augmented by TNF and direct contact with activated T cells. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that various adhesion molecules and multiple components of cytokine, complement and JAK-STAT signaling pathways are upregulated in FRCs in the presence of activated T cells. Based on these data, current efforts aim to identify the molecules involved in the direct stromal cell-T cell interaction influencing NO production by FRCs. This negative regulatory feedback mechanism is likely of great relevance to regulation of immune responses either to prevent excessive T cell expansion or to avoid structural damage within LNs caused by the expanding T cell pool.",

We used single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess differential hemodynamic responses to hand and foot stimulation for the group and in a single subject approach. The primary somatosensory cortex (SI) shows a clear somatotopic organization ipsi- and contralaterally to painful stimulation. Furthermore, a differential representation of hand and foot stimulation appeared within the contralateral opercular--insular region of the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). This result provides evidence that both SI and SII encode spatial information of nociceptive stimuli without additional information from the tactile system and highlights the concept of a redundant representation of basic discriminative stimulus features in human somatosensory cortices, which seems adequate in view of the evolutionary importance of pain perception.",

This has resulted in a proliferation of tools and applications that can help end-users and large-scale event organizers to better plan and manage their activities. In this process of analysis of the information originating from social networks, an important aspect is that of the geographic coordinates, i.e., geolocalisation, of the relevant information, which is necessary for several applications (e.g., on trending venues, traffic jams, etc.). Unfortunately, only a very small percentage of the twitter posts are geotagged, which significantly restricts the applicability and utility of such applications. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a framework for geolocating tweets that are not geotagged. Our solution is general, and estimates the location from which a post was generated by exploiting the similarities in the content between this post and a set of geotagged tweets, as well as their time-evolution characteristics. Contrary to previous approaches, our framework aims at providing accurate geolocation estimates at fine grain (i.e., within a city). The experimental evaluation with real data demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.",

Moreover, we show that the IPCNC actuator speed and efficiency are intimately related to the morphology of the composite electrode layer and the conductor network composites fabricated by ionic self-assembled layer-by-layer (LBL) exhibit higher strain response compared with that from the traditional IPCNC.

Most greenstones in the accretionary complex originated in oceanic spreading ridges and seamounts, and they formed far from the convergent margin. Some melange-like units in the supergroup, however, contain greenstones that were extruded upon and intruded into unconsolidated fine-grained terrigenous clastic sediments. It is inferred that eruption of the in situ greenstones resulted from igneous activity in the trench area. Geochemical signatures indicate that the greenstone protoliths were similar to mafic lavas generated at spreading ridges. Fossil ages of the strata containing in situ greenstones become younger over a distance of 1300 km eastward from Amami-Oshima (Cenomanian-Turonian) in the Ryukyu Is to central Japan (Late Maestrichtian-earliest Paleocene), implying that a site of igneous activity in the trench area migrated eastward along the Ryukyu Is and southwest Japan margin. Plate reconstructions of the northwest Pacific Ocean suggest the presence of the Kula-Pacific ridge near Late Cretaceous to early Paleogene Japan. In this context, it is suggested that the greenstones formed in response to Kula-Pacific ridge-forearc collision. \n \nAncient ridge-forearc collisions are best recognized by the presence of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) extruded on sediments inferred to have accumulated in the trench area. Diachronous occurrences of the strata associated with these MORB in an orogenic belt are useful for documenting the ridge collision through time.",

In view of nearby presence of the AF state, the Coulomb repulsion should play a significant role in the SC state. However, it has been believed that the SC state of A3C60 is driven mainly by the electron-phonon interaction because various experimental evidences point to a fully symmetric s-wave SC state being realized. In the conventional theory, the s-wave state is unfavorable in the presence of Coulomb repulsion. Then it is an open question why the Tc in fullerides is so high. In our previous study, we found that the s-wave pair can be formed even in the purely repulsive interaction model because of the characteristic band structure of fullerides [2]. The Kohn-Luttinger type interaction provides the attraction by Coulomb interaction. In this contribution, we demonstrate cooperation, rather than competition, between electron-phonon interaction and Coulomb repulsion for the s-wave pairing. We solve the gap equation with an effective interaction which include both Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions, and determine the most stable SC state. According to our result, we propose that the high Tc in actual fullerides comes from the cooperation between Coulomb repulsion and electron-phonon interaction.",

In this analysis the elevated heat pump hypothesis and the solar dimming effect associated with aerosol loading are verified and are found to be consistent with our simulations. When increased aerosol loading is found on the Himalayas slopes in the pre-monsoon period (April-May), an intensification in early monsoon rainfall over India is obtained. An increase in rainfall and cloudiness during the early monsoon has a cooling effect on the land surface. Here it is verified that this cooling is produced also through the solar dimming effect by the presence of more dust from the deserts brought by an increased westerly flow in early monsoon season. A subsequent reduction in monsoon rainfall over India is found, with a beginning of this decrease in northern India. As these results, obtained with a fully coupled model, reproduce a reasonably realistic pattern, it is possible to consider absorbing aerosols as a possible source of seasonal predictability of the Asian summer monsoon over the Indian subcontinent.",

We achieve this goal by combining statistical (a proposed fault-tolerant cluster algorithm) and security (threshold cryptography) techniques with application-aware checks to exploit the data\/computation that is partially and naturally replicated in wireless applications. We have prototyped an inner-circle framework with the ns-2 network simulator, and we use it to demonstrate the idea of inner-circle consistency in two significant wireless scenarios: (1) the neutralization of black hole attacks in AODV networks and (2) the neutralization of sensor errors in a target detection\/localization application executed over a wireless sensor network.",

Clinical examination revealed the presence of multiple coalescent, red to violaceous, indurated nodules and papules in a dermatomal distribution, along the T4–T7 neurotomes, at the lower right side of the thorax (Fig. 1a). A full body examination uncovered a subtle ipsilateral retraction of the nipple, firmly attached to a palpable tumor located beneath the areola. Furthermore, ipsilateral palpable axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes were detected. The patient’s medical history was unremarkable. Under the clinical suspicion of metastatic skin disease, we performed an incisional skin biopsy. Histological examination showed the dermal invasion of adenoid neoplastic cells compatible with metastatic carcinoma of the breast (Fig. 1b). Subsequent fine needle aspiration cytology of the breast mass was consistent with carcinoma of the breast. Further laboratory examination revealed bone and lung metastases; the patient was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer and treated accordingly. Cutaneous metastasis from an internal malignancy is a relatively frequent manifestation and is reported to occur in 5–10% of malignancies. In the vast majority of cases, it represents a sign of disease progression and is characterized by a wide array of clinical presentations. Breast cancer is the neoplasia most commonly associated with skin metastases. However, the arrangement of skin lesions in a dermatomal distribution is highly unusual: only 10 cases of zosteriform cutaneous metastasis related to breast carcinoma have been published in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a dermatomal cutaneous metastasis originating from breast carcinoma in a male patient. From a morphological perspective, dermatomal metastatic skin disease usually (in seven of 10 published cases) manifests with solid papulonodular lesions, as in our patient. Vesicobullous lesions have been reported in only three individuals. In addition to breast carcinoma, other primary malignancies associated with zosteriform patterns of skin metastases include melanoma, systemic and cutaneous B cell and T cell lymphomas, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tumors, and angiosarcoma and Kaposi’s sarcoma. Possible explanations for the zosteriform spread of cancer cells in the skin include vascular (lymphatic or hematogenous) spread, neural spread, the surgical implantation of malignant cells in the skin, and Koebnerization at the site of previous herpes zoster. Given that our patient had not undergone any surgical procedures before the development of the cutaneous metastasis, and his medical history was negative for herpes zoster, we suggest that",

If diagnosed at early stages, melanoma can be cured with relatively simple surgery. Globally, 20% of melanoma patients will die, but when diagnosed with thick (more advanced \/ later stage) tumours, the probability of dying increases by up to 60%. The best strategy to improve survival is with early diagnosis. The identification of people at risk is essential. Around 10% of cases occur in a familial context. This means that these individuals have an inherited genetic risk of developing melanoma explained by the presence of alterations (mutations) in specific genes. In a family with known mutation, healthy individuals who carry the mutation can be included in early detection programs that allow the diagnosis of melanomas at early stages. But the gene\/genes responsible for this risk is still unknown in more than 70% of families. This study, from Spain, aimed to evaluate the prevalence of mutations in two genes (POT1 and TERT) in Spanish melanoma‐prone families without known mutated genes. The authors sequenced (a way of studying) both genes in cases from 228 families. They found mutations in nearly 2% of the families assessed. They additionally identified two patients in two families who also had thyroid malignances. If this is confirmed in additional studies, the melanoma‐prone families with mutations in this gene will also benefit from early diagnosis of thyroid tumours. No mutations were identified in TERT promoter indicating that this gene does not play an important role in familial melanoma susceptibility in Spain.",

The Singing Sheriff produced a string of Top Ten hits, placed over eighty songs on the country music charts, and founded the long-running country music periodical Music City News in 1963. Flamboyant, impulsive, and generous, he helped and encouraged a new generation of talented songwriter-performers that included Willie Nelson and Bill Anderson. In 2000, four years after his untimely death, Faron was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Presenting the first detailed portrayal of this lively and unpredictable country music star, Diane Diekman masterfully draws on extensive interviews with Young's family, band members, and colleagues. Impeccably researched, Diekman's narrative also weaves anecdotes from Louisiana Hayride and other old radio shows with ones from Young's business associates, including Ralph Emery. Her unique insider's look into Young's career adds to an understanding of the burgeoning country music entertainment industry during the key years from 1950 to 1980, when the music expanded beyond its original rural roots and blossomed into a national (ultimately, international) enterprise. Echoing Young's characteristic ability to entertain and surprise fans, Diekman combines an account of his public career with a revealing, intimate portrait of his personal life.",

However, these techniques have not been widely applied, partly because they tend to work least well in the most common case: on large software systems that have only partial specifications describing correct behavior—often a collection of independent assertions sprinkled throughout the program. \nRecent research has suggested that a large class of software bugs fall into the category of inconsistencies, or cases where two pieces of program code make incompatible assumptions. Existing approaches to inconsistency detection have used intentionally unsound techniques aimed at bug-finding rather than verification. In this dissertation, we describe an inconsistency detection analysis that extends previous work and is based on the foundation of the weakest precondition calculus. In the ideal case (a completely closed program and a perfect theorems prover), this analysis can serve as a full safety verification technique, while in realistic cases (where some code is unknown and theorem provers are incomplete) it can serve as bug finding technique with a low false-positive rate. It smooths the path from bug-finding to verification by using the same base analysis for both goals. \nOur analysis detects inconsistencies that come as violations of a property we call universal reachability. These violations can range from serious crash-causing bugs or security vulnerabilities to dead code, but usually indicate problems that should be fixed. We have applied our analysis to a large body of widely-used open-source software, and found a number of bugs, with few false positives.",

To deal with these problems, first, the original problem is transformed into whether a point is the solution of equation.

Renewed interest into astrocyte biology has transpired due to the fact that astrocytes are active participants with neurons in activities ranging from neural circuit formation, brain information processing, metabolic support to synaptogenesis and synaptic activity. Any perturbations in astrocyte function especially during pathological conditions may thus have profound effects on the optimal functioning or even survival of neurons. In this chapter, we provide a brief history about the discovery of astrocyte, discuss basic questions such as; what do astrocytes do? How astrocytes respond to inflammation? and their role in neuroinflammatory disorders? More specifically, the chapter details the role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV) associated neurocognitive disorders. The chapter also discusses how changes in astrocyte morphology and function results in dysregulation of astrocytic responses during inflammatory injury and its repercussions that ultimately leads to neuronal dysfunction or death. Finally, we discuss recent advances in how the knowledge about astrocytes has fostered newer ideas about brain functions and disease, which offer therapeutic leads to treat neuroinflammatory disorders. In summary, recent studies have provided novel insights into the role of astrocytes in a wide variety of neuroinflammatory and neurocognitive diseases, and future research on astrocyte pathophysiology is expected to provide new perspectives on importance of astrocytes in healthy and diseased brain.",

In this paper we want to test the generality of this finding by studying two tropical ants, Oecophylla smaragdina and Crematogaster sp., preying on fig wasps on the dioecious Ficus fistulosa in Brunei (Borneo). Behavioural tests in a Y-tube olfactometer showed that these two ants were attracted both to odours emitted by receptive figs and to those emitted by fig wasps (male and female of the pollinator, and a non-pollinating fig wasp) used here as a kairomone. Naive workers were not attracted to fig wasps, suggesting that olfactory learning may play a role in prey detection. We also found that O. smaragdina was much more likely to be present on figs of male trees (where fig wasps are more abundant), and that the abundance of this ant species varied strongly with developmental phase of figs on individual trees. Moreover, its aggressiveness was also strongly influenced by the nature of the object presented in our behavioural tests, the site of the test and the developmental phase of the fig tested. Investigation on the chemical and behavioural ecology of the different interacting species provides important insights into the intricate relationships supported by the fig–fig wasp mutualism.",

Using corneal topography to collect real data from patients, a computational model of cornea is constructed and a set of simulations were build to ensure the correctness of the system and to investigate the effect of corneal abnormalities in retinal image formation.",

The types and sizes of 100 asbestos fibers for each case were also analyzed. Asbestos bodies were counted with an optical microscope at 100x magnification, and asbestos fibers were counted with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 2000x magnification. Most asbestos fibers detected with TEM were longer than 3 microns (92.5%) and thicker than 0.1 microns (92.3%). Short fibers less than 2 microns--both chrysotile and amphiboles, as well as long, thin fibers less than 0.06 microns--would be missed at 2000x (TEM). An average of 1.37 (0.081-5.5) x 10(6) asbestos bodies and 164.8 (0.55-610) x 10(6) asbestos fibers per 5 g wet (0.88 g dry) lung tissue were found, and these values are higher than what was reported in mesothelioma cases without asbestosis that were reported previously. More than 13 (average = 266.2) asbestos bodies were found in a 4-micron-thick tissue section (average area = 3.24 cm2). One asbestos body in a section equaled approximately 5,000 per 5 g wet lung tissue. The intensity of fibrosis was minimal in one case, mild in four, moderate and severe in one each, and the intensity was correlated with the number of asbestos bodies and fibers. The fibrosis in the severe case may have been intensified by repeated infection. Crocidolite fibers were found most frequently (84.7%), were thin, and had a high aspect ratio by our counting rules. Crocidolite with a high aspect ratio may be most fibrogenic in the lung.",

Theoretical pKa's have been calculated for a set of 72 organic compounds with -OH and -OOH groups (48 with known experimental pKa's). This test set includes 17 aliphatic alcohols, 25 substituted phenols, and 30 hydroperoxides. Calculations in aqueous medium have been carried out with SMD implicit solvation and three hybrid DFT functionals (B3LYP, ωB97XD, and M06-2X) with two basis sets (6-31+G(d,p) and 6-311++G(d,p)). The effect of explicit water molecules on calculated pKa's was assessed by including up to three water molecules. pKa's calculated with only SMD implicit solvation are found to have average errors greater than 6 pKa units. Including one explicit water reduces the error by about 3 pKa units, but the error is still far from chemical accuracy. With B3LYP\/6-311++G(d,p) and three explicit water molecules in SMD solvation, the mean signed error and standard deviation are only -0.02 ± 0.55; a linear fit with zero intercept has a slope of 1.005 and R2 = 0.97.

        "abstrak":"The environmental problems caused by the increase of pollutant. It is the result of industrial waste and environmental accidents. One of the main sources of water pollution is suspended solids. When these suspended particles settle to the bottom of a water body, they become sediments. Optical methods offer two possibilities: scattering and transmission. The design of optical sensor systems is based on the interaction between the photons of the electromagnetic radiation and suspended particles in water. Pollution usually results in higher total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations or turbidity. Water pollution is caused by any chemical, physical or biological change in the quality of water. Suspended solids are small particles of solid pollutants that float on the surface of, or are suspended in waters. Water pollution has become increasingly critical in this present-day, whether in the developed or the developing countries. Total suspended solids (TSS) in water can be detected by a number of optical sensing techniques, which involve light interaction with suspended particles in water. The measurements of the transmittance give a method for determining the concentration of the particles. The objectives of this study are to derive multispectral absorption algorithm and to develop an optical system, which is based on absorption measurements for measuring the concentration of total suspended solids,TSS in water. The multispectral absorption algorithm has been developed and a new multispectral optical sensor system designed for measuring total suspended solids TSS concentrations in polluted water. The development of the optical algorithm was based on the Beer-Lambert law. Firstly, the water samples used for calibration were filtered and dried to obtain the TSS values. In this study, three light emitting diodes were used as sensing emitters (sources) and a silicon phototransistor as radiations detector. The radiation values were determined from the output voltage readings of the sensor system. An electronic circuit was designed and the readings were measured by using a digital multimeter. The major advantages in using an LED as the light sources are its relatively low power consumption and ability to be modulated electronically at rapid rates. Standard polluted samples were prepared for sensors calibration. As the concentration of total suspended solids P was increased, the intensity of the transmitted light decreased. The level of the photocurrent was linearly proportional to the pollutants concentration. The proposed multispectral algorithm was calibrated using the measured parameters. Its accuracy was determined based on correlation coefficient,R and the value of the root-mean square errors,RMSE. The results showed a good correlation between the radiation values and the total suspended solids concentrations. This optical system provides various advantages over the current portable turbidity meter, which uses a single infrared source. The main advantage is its capability provide water pollution levels accurately (i.e. total suspended solids concentration). It only requires inexpensive components and can be assembled easily. The proposed algorithm produced a high correlation coefficient and low root mean square error value. This new methodology is very important for measuring and monitoring TSS in polluted water areas.",

Aim: The aim of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy of iodine-restricted food versus pharmacological therapy with methimazole in client-owned cats with hyperthyroidism. Methods: Indoor cats with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism (consistent clinical signs and serum total thyroxine concentration greater than 50 nmol\/l) were assigned to one of three groups: (A) received an iodine-restricted food as a single therapy; (B) received transdermal methimazole in pluronic lecithin organogel; and (C) received oral methimazole. In all groups, clinical parameters, biochemistry, and serum total thyroxine were evaluated at baseline and 10, 30, 60, and 90 days after treatment began. Results: Thirty-four cats were enrolled in the study (group A: n = 14; group B: n = 11; group C: n = 9). No significant differences were found between groups at diagnosis for signalment, clinical and laboratory findings, including serum total thyroxine concentrations. In all the groups, serum total thyroxine concentration decreased significantly following the baseline measurement. After 90 days of treatment, serum creatinine increased significantly only in the methimazole-treated groups. Liver enzyme activities decreased significantly only in group B, while no significant decreases were detected in groups A and C at any time. Conclusion: These results suggest that iodine-restricted food is effective at reducing the total thyroxine concentration in the serum of hyperthyroid cats. Moreover, the iodine-restricted food did not cause any increase in serum creatinine concentrations and failed to improve liver enzymes abnormalities. These findings could indicate a persistent hyperthyroid state in cats treated with iodine-restricted food despite normalization of serum total thyroxine concentrations.",

However, the process of within-host de novo mutant generation and evolutionary selection that underlies these antigenic sweeps is poorly understood. Here, we investigate mutational patterns between evolutionarily closely related human seasonal influenza viruses using host age as a proxy for immune experience. The systematic analysis of >25,000 virus sequences showed that individuals with substantially differing immune histories were frequently (30–62%) infected by viruses with identical amino acid sequences. Viruses from immunologically inexperienced individuals were as likely to possess substitutions with potential phenotypic relevance as highly experienced individuals. Mutations likely to cause antigenic changes were rare among closely related viruses and not associated with extent of host immune experience. These findings suggest that individual immune positive selection plays a limited role in the evolution of seasonal influenza viruses.An analysis of 25,000 human seasonal influenza virus sequences reveals no distinguishable mutational patterns across individuals with different immune histories, suggesting a limited role of individual immune positive selection in the evolution these viruses.",

When the cystic duct was clamped, PGF2alpha markedly increased the gall bladder pressure while both PGE1 and PGE2 increased it slightly. This observation suggests that the smooth muscle in the gall bladder is markedly stimulated by PGF2alpha and stimulated to a lesser degree by PGE1 or PGE2. Furthermore, PGF2alpha appears to constrict, and PGE1 or PGE2 appears to relax the sphincter of Oddi.

Motivated by theoretical expectations of light cosmic strings in superstring cosmology, improvements in experimental sensitivity, and recent demonstrations of large, stable loop formation from a primordial network, this study explores a new range of string parameters with masses lighter than previously investigated. A standard 'one-scale' model for string loop formation is assumed. Background spectra are calculated numerically for dimensionless string tensions G{mu}\/c{sup 2} between 10{sup -7} and 10{sup -18}, and initial loop sizes as a fraction of the Hubble radius {alpha} from 0.1 to 10{sup -6}. The spectra show a low frequency power-law tail, a broad spectral peak due to loops decaying at the present epoch (including frequencies higher than their fundamental mode, and radiation associated with cusps), and a flat (constant energy density) spectrum at high frequencies due to radiation from loops that decayed during the radiation-dominated era. The string spectrum is distinctive and unlike any other known source. The peak of the spectrum for light strings appears at high frequencies, significantly affecting predicted signals. The spectra of the cosmic string backgrounds are compared with current millisecond pulsar limitsmore » and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) sensitivity curves. For models with large stable loops ({alpha}=0.1), current pulsar-timing limits exclude G{mu}\/c{sup 2}>10{sup -9}, a much tighter limit on string tension than achievable with other techniques, and within the range of current models based on brane inflation.

Feature vectors for all the classes are generated by extracting the most relevant features from the corresponding clusters and used for further classification. Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machines are used to perform the classification task. Experiments are conducted on four datasets and the accuracy obtained by performing specific feature extraction for a particular data set is compared with generic feature extraction scheme.

It appears to be spreading to the western border of Thailand along the Thai–Myanmar border, and will probably spread to other endemic areas of the world in the near future. This raises a serious concern on the long-term efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies, as these combination therapies currently constitute the last effective and most tolerable treatment for multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Attempts have been made by a diverse array of stakeholders to prevent the emergence of new foci of artemisinin resistance, as well as to limit the spread of resistance to the original foci. The success in achieving this goal depends on effective integration of containment and surveillance programs with other malaria control measures, with support from both basic and operational research.",

In the eight mines investigated, opal occurs in lenticular horizons within an unwelded ignimbrite bed. Moreover, several deposits are superimposed in the sequence, indicating that gem opal formation occurred several times in the same place. We observed that, in contrast to the other beds, the opal-bearing horizons are strongly weathered: volcanic glass is altered to smectite, rocks with a granular microstructure are apparent, and cavities are covered by illuvial clays. These features are typical of pedogenetic processes. Plant fossils in the opals reveal a well preserved cellular structure composed of chalcedony. These observations are consistent over all the mines, supporting the pedogenetic model for precious opal formation in the Wegel Tena area.",

Results Colonic scores decreased most significantly after ovalbumin and lipopolysaccharide nasal administration (P<0.05). Colonic expression of forkhead box P3 in rats after ovalbumin and lipopolysaccharide oral (P<0.05) and nasal administration (P<0.01) were both significantly higher than untreated rats. TLR2 expression on CD4+CD25+ T cells decreased most significantly after ovalbumin and lipopolysaccharide nasal therapies (P<0.01). TLR4 colonic expression decreased significantly after ovalbumin and lipopolysaccharide oral administration (P<0.05) and lipopolysaccharide oral administration (P<0.05).

Cnidarian bleaching is caused by a variety of environmental stressors, such as elevated seawater temperature associated with global climate change, and by pollutants, such as herbicides and metals. Several cellular events have been described to explain symbiosis dysfunction and bleaching. Excess or damaged Symbiodinium symbionts are removed through a variety of mechanisms, including exocytosis, apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. However, few studies have compared in the same species the relative involvement of these mechanisms, according to the stress inducing the bleaching. In this study, we used two different treatments —temperature and menthol— to induce bleaching in the sea anemone Anemonia viridis. By monitoring the ultrastructural tissue modifications, in control specimens we observed a basal rate of in situ symbiont digestion —or symbiophagy— induced by starvation. Symbiophagy was strongly induced in menthol-treated specimens and was the main cellular process of bleaching, whereas apoptosis and necrosis predominated in hyperthermal-induced bleaching. These results suggested a host effect through autophagy in menthol-treated specimens. These observations also suggested that symbiont removal may result from reengagement of the phagosomal maturation process in the host. These overall data demonstrate that several Symbiodinium cell removal mechanisms coexist and that stressors can activate one or more of these pathways, depending on the stress type, intensity or duration.",

The control climate of the GCM is zonally symmetric; this symmetric climate is then perturbed by a monopole SST anomaly centered at 40°N. Two experiments, with SST anomalies of opposite sign, have been conducted. The stationary response is roughly linear in the sign of the SST anomaly, despite the fact that precipitation shows strong nonlinearity. The linear model, which is an exact linearization of the GCM equations in use, when forced by anomalous heating and transients, reproduces the GCM's stationary response excellently. The low-level transient eddy heat fluxes act to damp the lower level temperature signal. When this damping effect is mimicked by a horizontal thermal diffusion in the linear model, the response to the diabatic heating alone gi...",

The cumulative fatigue damage is computed based on the S-N method. Simulation results show that the tower base fore-aft bending moment is improved, in terms of extreme value and fatigue damage.

        "abstrak":"67r aromaticity has been investigated for a number of four-membered rings by ab initio MO methods. The rings were fully optimized within the symmetry constraints. The order of the stationary points was established by calculating the harmonic frequencies of the normal modes. It is shown that carbocycles show no 67r aromaticity, in contrast with the nitrocycles. The stability of the planar Dd rings is determined by two factors: the bond strength in the ring and the stability of the planar orientation of the ring substituent. The latter is strongly influenced by 1,3 7r repulsions, which result from the fact that in 67 four-membered rings the two highest occupied A molecular orbitals are I ,2-nonbonding and 1,3-antibonding. The role of the hydrogen substituents is investigated by the inclusion of polarization functions on the ring atoms. I t is found that the pl-d hybridization reduces the electron repulsion by \"bending\" the ?r frame outward, thereby increasing the electron density above the hydrogen bond. This stimulates the out-of-plane vibrations of the hydrogen atoms as shown by smaller force constants. Aromaticity in conjugated hydrocarbon rings has been studied extensively for more than a century.' In principle, aromaticity is not restricted to hydrocarbons and may well include both homoand heterocyclic rings. Concepts of aromaticity have been successfully applied in theories of chemical structure and reactivity. Our understanding of aromatic molecules rests primarily on the 4n + 2 *-electron criterion, known as Hiickel's rule, describing the delocalization of 7r electrons. Recently, however, there has been some debate in literature concerning the origin of aromaticity.2-'\\ Following Berry's suggestion,12 Shaik et al.,2 applying a valence-bond correlation diagram model, proposed that the A components of benzene are unstable toward localizing distortions and that the D6h symmetry is imposed by the u frame, which opposes the T propensities. I n addition to a b initio quantum chemical calculations= supporting their conclusions, the instability of hexazine (hexaazabenzene),\" the all-nitrogen analogue of benzene, gives a clear example of the fact that aromaticity is not simply the result of topological properties of electron count and mode of delocalization. Although the provocative model of Shaik and Hiberty has been criticized by various authors:-* similar conclusions have been reached by Stanger and Vollhardt? Epiotis? and Voter and G ~ d d a r d . ~ Yet another challenge to the view that *-electron delocalization is the basis of aromaticity is provided by spin-coupled valence-bond calculations by Cooper et It is argued that the aromatic characteristics of benzene arise from the symmetric coupling of electron spins around the ring and that ( I ) For a general reference, see: Garratt, P.

It is therefore important to determine the species distribution and characteristics of endophytic fungi in tobacco. Here, two parasitic fungi Leptosphaerulina chartarum and Curvularia trifolii were isolated and identified from normal tobacco tissue. We sequenced the mitogenomes of these two species and analysed their features, gene content, and evolutionary histories. The L. chartarum and C. trifolii mitochondrial genomes were 68,926 bp and 59,100 bp long circular molecules with average GC contents of 28.60% and 29.31%, respectively. The L. chartarum mitogenome contained 36 protein coding genes, 26 tRNA genes, and 2 rRNA genes (rrnL and rrnS), which were located on both strands. The C. trifolii mitogenome contained 26 protein coding genes, 29 tRNA genes, and 2 rRNA genes (rrnL and rrnS). The L. chartarum 26 tRNAs ranged from 70 bp to 84 bp in length, whereas the 29 tRNAs in C. trifolii ranged from 71 bp to 85 bp. L. chartarum and C. trifolii mtDNAs had an identical mitochondrial gene order and orientation and were phylogenetically identified as sisters. These data therefore provide an understanding of the gene content and evolutionary history of species within Pleosporales.",

        "tahun_terbit":2012,
        "abstrak":"In urban areas, the occurrence of disasters can cause extensive damage to human society. For this reason, evacuation, regarded as a critical course of action to relocate people and property, helps to alleviate loss of life and property to a great extent. Risk associated with evacuation is an abstract concept that cannot be easily conceptualized. This paper develops a model for assessing and visualizing the risks associated with the evacuation process in response to potential catastrophes. Understanding of evacuation risk, the potential for losing transport connections and the difficulty of transferring rescue resources, was previously limited by considering pre-disaster factors only. This study mitigates such limitation by extending previous research to include the contingent post-disaster factors that have received scant attention to date. Two contingent post-disaster factors: the spatial impact of the disaster and the potential for traffic congestion caused by the evacuee routing behaviors, are discussed in detail and integrated into the model along with other pre-disaster factors. A case study on the transportation network of Beijing, China is used to demonstrate the value of the model. This paper asserts that the notion of evacuation risk is not a static evaluation of such factors as road vulnerability; rather it involves a dynamic process where contingent factors associated with disastrous events play a role. This model can help city emergency planners to identify urban infrastructures that may hinder an efficient evacuation process because of their deficient configuration. Language: en",

        "abstrak":"ABSTRACT Encarsia formosa Gahan (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) is an aphelinid endoparasitoid of the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). Encarsia lycopersici (De Santis) is a parasitoid of the same host, but it is not known if both parasitoids occupy the same niche. In this study, the duration of development of the parasitoids, and the ability of both species to parasitize the 4 preimaginal instars of T. vaporariorum were determined. Results indicate that both E. formosa and E. lycopersici can parasitize all preimaginal instars of T. vaporariorum, and thus effectively occupy the same parasitoid niches, and they are part of the same parasitoid guild. However, variations in parasitism of the different preimaginal instars were observed. Encarsia lycopersici showed a higher parasitism rate on the first instar than on the third and fourth instars of T. vaporariorum. In contrast to E. formosa, which exhibited a lower parasitism rate on the first instar than on the fourth instar. In addition, E. lycopersici showed higher parasitism rate than E. formosa on the first instar of this host. This suggests that E. lycopersici may have a competitive advantage in exploiting the host, as it is the first to occupy it.",

Suppressors of these toxicities map to a previously characterized gene, cpxA, that encodes the sensor kinase protein of a two‐component regulatory system. These activated cpxA alleles, designated as cpxA*, stimulate transcription of the periplasmic protease DegP (Danese et aL, 1995), which in turn catalyses degradation of the tripartite fusion protein. In contrast, degradation of precursor LamBA23D is not significantly stimulated in a cpxA* suppressor background. In fact, increased levels of DegP in a wild‐type background stabilized this protein. While a functional degP gene is required for full cpxaA* ‐mediated suppression of both toxic envelope proteins, residual suppression is seen in cpxA*degP::Tn10 double mutants. Furthermore, cpxA* mutations suppress the toxicity conferred by the LamB‐LacZ hybrid protein, which exerts its effects in the cytoplasm, sequestered from DegP. Together, these observations suggest that the activated Cpx pathway regulates additional downstream targets that contribute to suppression. A subset of these targets may constitute a regulon involved in relieving extracytoplasmic and\/or secretion‐related stress.",

Evidence of genetic exchange between diverging taxa is reported frequently, although most studies fail to show how hybridization and introgression contribute to the adaptation and differentiation of introgressed taxa. Here, we report a population genomics approach to test the role of hybridization and introgression in the evolution of the Picea likiangensis species complex, which comprises four taxa occurring in the biodiversity hotspot of the Hengduan–Himalayan mountains. Based on 84,793 SNPs detected in transcriptomes of 82 trees collected from 35 localities, we identified 18 hybrids (including backcrosses) distributed within the range boundaries of the four taxa. Coalescent simulations, for each pair of taxa and for all taxa taken together, rejected several tree‐like divergence models and supported instead a reticulate evolution model with secondary contacts occurring during Pleistocene glacial cycles after initial divergence in the late Pliocene. Significant gene flow occurred among some taxa after secondary contact according to an analysis based on modified ABBA–BABA statistics that accommodated a rapid diversification scenario. A novel finding was that introgression between certain taxa can contribute to increasing divergence (and possibly reproductive isolation) between those taxa and other taxa within a complex at some loci. These results illuminate the reticulate nature of evolution within the P. likiangensis complex and highlight the value of population genomic data in detecting the effects of introgression in the rapid diversification of related taxa.",

I found particularly interesting and well-presented the discussion of gas adsorption on semiconducting and metal oxide surfaces, where the authors make an extremely good job at reviewing such complex systems and the chemical processes occurring at their interfaces. The last chapter, describing the manipulation of atoms and molecule with a scanning tunnelling microscope, is the only one that, in my opinion, would benefit from a more thorough discussion on the chemistry and the chemical reactions happening at the surface. A few paragraphs on the recent advances in tip-assisted chemistry and electrochemistry in the scanning probe environment would have greatly expanded the focus of the chapter, ensuring a more comprehensive discussion. These volumes are clearly not designed as an introduction to the field, and a degree of knowledge of surface science is needed to follow the discussion. To the experienced scientist they represent a useful collection of important concepts supported by a vast bibliography, and I am sure that I will find myself consulting these books more than a few times over the next few years.

During the past 60 years, HSID methodologies advanced steadily from traditional scan based methods to statistical model based methods and have reached the sophistication of encompassing advanced statistical models with many variations and refinements while there still exist a number of theoretical issues unsolved. Consequently, these advanced models are not widely used in the practice of transportation engineering. This paper investigated the performance of an easy to use alternative to estimate the EEPDO -- using machine learning techniques of K nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and compared it against the prevalent statistical model -- Negative Binomial (NB). NB assumes that the raw data follow a certain Gamma distribution which is not ubiquitously hold for crash data. Comparatively, being a nonparametric predictor, KNN is expected to produce better estimation on crash data in that it requires no assumption on the raw data. For experiment, a case study was conducted on highway US 49 in Harrison County of Mississippi. The results indicated that KNN outperformed NB.",

Soil sequences differing in the character of their agrogenic changes were studied in the rural area of ancient Olbia with a centuries-long history of diverse economic activities, including crop growing. The agrophysical, agrochemical, and geochemical characteristics were examined in order to assess the soil transformation processes in a sequence from the initial virgin soil to the cultivated soil of the antique period in the fallow stage, the soil under recent (three-five years) fallow, and modern plowed soils in the area of ancient farming. It was found that the contents of humus, total nitrogen, and carbonates; the water stability of the soil aggregates; and the portion of coprolites in the agronomically valuable aggregate fraction are sensitive indicators of the duration of the agrogenesis in the dark chestnut soils. The manifestation of agrogenic processes at different hierarchical levels of the spatial and temporal organization of the soil system depended on the duration and intensity of the farming practices. Temporal abandonment of intensely cultivated lands in traditional farming practices with periodic initiation of the natural processes of restoration of the soil fertility can be considered a suitable measure to regulate agrogenic loads on the soils with the aim to enhance the self-organization processes in the soil system.",

We provide an efficient algorithm to perform this inference. A particularly interesting application where this attack can be exploited is to breach privacy in the setting of Membership Inference Attacks. These attacks exploit the vulnerabilities of exposing models trained on customer data to queries made by an adversary. Privacy auditing tools for measuring leakage from sensitive datasets assess the total privacy leakage based on the adversary’s predictions for datapoint membership. An instance of the proposed attack can hence, cause complete membership privacy breach, obviating any attack model training or access to side knowledge with the adversary. Moreover, our algorithm is agnostic to the model under attack and hence, enables perfect membership inference even for models that do not memorize or overfit. In particular, our observations provide insight into the extent of information leakage from statistical aggregates and how they can be exploited.",

The proposed system uses the radar installed at the intersection to collect vehicle dynamics. The collected data is processed to calculate deflection angles of vehicles corresponding to the road. The smoothing technique is adopted to filter the noise of calculated deflection angles. The ensemble methods are utilized to construct the model to predict future deflection angles of vehicles corresponding to the road. According to the predicted deflection angle, we can predict which road a vehicle will take at a special intersection and alert other vehicles when necessary. To assess the performance of the model prediction, a real-world experiment is carried out, which utilizes radar to collect the dataset at Kaixuan 4th Rd. and Zhenxing Rd., Qianzhen Dist., Kaohsiung City, Taiwan.

On the other hand a system test was conducted to determine face recognition system capabilities in the detection of seeked persons from the videostream of a monitoring camera. This article describes database used in the investigation as well as concept and realization of the algorithm and system tests. First results of the tests are presented. The project is carried out in close collaboration between Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation (Bundeskriminalamt, BKA), the Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt fur Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, BSI) and the Fraunhofer-IGD. Since the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001 biometrical identification systems have attracted stronger interest of the security agencies. The adopted german legislation package of anti-terror measures contains the inclusion of further biometrical features in ID cards and passports, in order to verify the identity of an ID card holder. Next biometrical identification for the authentication of immigrants and visas applicants is discussed (immigration legislation, counter terrorism legislation) [BMI02]. The benefit is obvious: Biometrical system are expected to carry out identity determinations resp. comparisons essentially quicker and more objectively [BIOIS00]. Thus, for instance, with the EURODAC system a European, state-spanning biometrical identification system was introduced which is used for the storage of the fingerprints of asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants. All participating countries (all EU states except Denmark, as well as Norway and Iceland) acquire the fingerprints of the appropriate persons older than 14 years and import them into the system. If the EURODAC system finds out that the features are already registered, the asylum-seeker should be sent back in the land in which the original registration took place. 1 Bundesamt fur Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, http:\/\/www.bsi..de\/ 2 Fraunhofer-Institute for Computer Graphics, http:\/\/www.igd.fraunhofer.de\/igd-a8\/ 3 Bundeskriminalamt, http:\/\/www.bka.de\/",

        "abstrak":"TO THE EDITOR \n \nXeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E (XP-E) patients exhibit sunlight-induced lentiginous pigmentation without blistering on minimal sun exposure, yet they are prone to develop multiple skin cancers. Only eight XP-E patients have been reported (Bootsma et al., 1970; De Weerd-Kastelein et al., 1974; Kraemer et al., 1975; Nichols et al., 1996; Rapic et al., 1998; Itoh et al., 1999, 2000; Rapic-Otrin et al., 2003) with mutations in the DDB2 gene (Tang and Chu, 2002; Itoh, 2006), resulting in the loss of UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) activity (Nichols et al., 2000; Rapic-Otrin et al., 2003) (Table 1). UV-DDB is a heterodimer of DDB1 (p127) and DDB2 (p48) (Keeney et al., 1994; Kazantsev et al., 1996) that binds with high affinity to DNA damaged by UV and is involved in initiation of global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) (Sugasawa, 2010). \n \n \n \nTable 1 \n \nClinical features and DDB2 mutations \n \n \n \nWe identified four adult XP-E patients from three kindreds with large numbers of skin cancers (Table 1). Patients’ written, informed consent was obtained. The Declaration of Helsinki guidelines were followed and all necessary institutional approvals were obtained. Patient XP1GO, 45 years old, in family A from Germany never experienced a blistering sunburn (Figure 1a). Diagnosed with XP at age 22, he works as a train conductor. His first tumor was removed at age 12. He had >400 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCCs) and 6 melanomas treated by age 30, and now he develops ~20 skin cancers per year. He has no neurological abnormalities. Patient XP37BE is a 45-year-old Caucasian female of Dutch ancestry in family B living in the western United States (Figure 1b). She denies ever having a blistering sunburn. She developed a keratoacanthoma on her face at 7 years and was diagnosed with XP. XP37BE has had >300 BCC and SCC skin cancers but no melanomas. She has no neurological abnormalities. Patient XP66BE is a 43-year-old brother of XP37BE. He was diagnosed with XP at age 4 at the same time his older sister was diagnosed and exhibits similar clinical symptoms, yet, milder because of improved sun protection. Patient XP408BE is a 53-year-old Caucasian female in family C from the eastern United States (Figure 1c). She had no sunburns and tanned easily, but did experience significant photophobia. At age 14, she was found to have multiple skin cancers (BCCs and SCCs) on her face and a diagnosis of XP was made. She has no XP neurological abnormalities. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nClinical features and DDB2 crystal structure \n \n \n \nAll cells were either established at the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository, the NCI Repository, or in the Department of Dermatology, Goettingen, Germany. Plasmid host cell reactivation assay was performed for cellular DNA repair capacity measurement (Emmert et al., 2000). The cells were transfected with a UV-treated plasmid containing a reporter (luciferase) gene (pCMVLuc). Compared with normal and XP variant cells, XP1GO, XP37BE, XP66BE, and XP408BE\/GM01389 cells had a reduced level of luciferase expression whereas severe XP-B control cells had an even lower level (data not shown). To determine the complementation group we co-transfected the UV-irradiated pCMVLuc with plasmids that carry cloned wild-type XP complementary DNA (cDNA). Only co-transfection of the DDB2 cDNA resulted in markedly enhanced reporter gene activities (data not shown). \n \nHuman primary XP-E fibroblasts have been reported to show abnormally low or undetectable levels of p53 and its downstream-regulated proteins (Hwang et al., 1999; Itoh et al., 2003; Itoh, 2006). In agreement with this observation, the intensities of p53 and p21 bands were reduced ~60–80% and 40–60%, respectively, in untreated XP37BE, XP66BE, and XP408BE\/GM01389 cells (ECL Western blotting; Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) (data not shown). \n \nSequence analysis ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NC_000011.8\",\"term_id\":\"51511727\",\"term_text\":\"NC_000011.8\"}}NC_000011.8 for genomic sequence, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NM_000107.1\",\"term_id\":\"4557514\",\"term_text\":\"NM_000107.1\"}}NM_000107.1 for cDNA, and {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NP_000098.1\",\"term_id\":\"4557515\",\"term_text\":\"NP_000098.1\"}}NP_000098.1 for protein) revealed a, to our knowledge previously unreported, homozygous C-to-A transversion (c.914 C > A) in exon 7 in the DDB2 gene of XP1GO. This missense mutation resulted in a p.Thr305Asn substitution (Table 1). His parents and brother were heterozygous for this mutation. The restriction enzyme BtgI cuts the normal but not the mutant sequence. \n \nXP37BE and XP66BE showed homozygous G-to-A transitions in exon 6 of DDB2. This missense mutation (c.818 G > A) resulted in p.Arg273His and was also found in their mother and father but not their unaffected brother (Table 1). This mutation inactivates a HhaI restriction site. This mutation was previously reported in XP2RO and XP3RO cells from the Netherlands (Bootsma et al., 1970; De Weerd-Kastelein et al., 1974; Kraemer et al., 1975; Nichols et al., 1996). \n \nThe cells from patient XP408BE had compound heterozygous mutations in exon 8. One allele showed a T-to-C transversion (c.1049 T > C) resulting in p.Leu350Pro, and the other allele had a three-base deletion (c.1045_1047del) resulting in p.Asn349del (Table 1). These two mutations were identical to the mutations previously reported in cell line GM01389 (Nichols et al., 2000). We measured 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DDB2 gene to determine the relationship between these two cell lines (XP408BE and GM01389). All 15 SNPs were identical in both cells (data not shown). CODIS DNA fingerprinting of highly polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs) was then performed (Azari et al., 2007). All 13 CODIS core STR loci were detected and were identical in both cell lines (data not shown). Thus, the likelihood that the cells are not identical is approximately one in one billion. Indeed, the patient recalled having a skin biopsy for fibroblast culture when she was 21 years old. \n \nFigure 1d shows the crystal structure of DDB2 stabilized by DDB1 and contacting the damaged DNA extensively (Chu and Yang, 2008; Scrima et al., 2008). The heterozygous DDB2 mutations (Leu350Pro and Asn349del) in XP408BE impair DDB1 binding (DDB1–DDB2 interface mutations). In contrast, the Arg273His mutation in XP37BE and XP66BE directly interferes with DNA binding (DNA-binding mutation). The new mutation, p.Thr305Asn in XP1GO cells, is located in the WD domain near a known Asp307Tyr mutation. This mutation has been reported to disrupt damage detection and complex formation with DDB1 (Rapic et al., 1998; Rapic-Otrin et al., 2003). \n \nThe diagnosis of XP-E can be considered in adults with freckle-like pigmentation without blistering on minimal sun exposure who have many skin cancers.",

        "abstrak":"Background:In an effort to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the exercise electrocardiography (ECG to detect coronary artery disease, exercise-induced changes in Q, R and S wave amplitudes has been evaluated in conjunction with or without ST segment changes. We measured the exercise-induced changes in Q, R and S wave amplitudes, and calculated the Athens QRS score to assess its diagnostic value. Materials and method: Fifty patients who underwent the exercise test and MIBI myocardial scan and were proved to have coronary artery diameter stenosis ≥50% in coronary angiography were included in the patient group. Data of forty- nine persons showing negative findings in the exercise test and MIBI scan were used as control. The exercise test was performed according to the modified Bruce protocol using Marquette case 16. Exercise ECG was positive in 58% (29\/50 of the patient group. The Q, R and S wave amplitudes at peak exercise were subtracted from the values of standing position at rest to obtain Athens QRS score. Results:The mean age of patients and control were 54.5±9.4 years and 49.8±11.4 years respectively (p=NS, and their exercise capacity was 8.5±3.1 mets and 9.8±1.9 mets respectively (p=NSThe values of △(R-Q-SV5+△(R-Q-S aVF and △(R-Q-SaVF were significantly lower in patients than the control (0.85±6.60 mm vs 3.72±5.09 mm, p=0.017, -0.60±4.76 mm vs 1.00±2.72 mm, p=0.030, and the values of △QV5 and △SaVF were significantly higher in patients than the control (-0.045±0.65 mm vs -0.41±0.78 mm, p=0.012, -0.84± 1.90 mm vs -1.62±1.60 mm, p=0.009. However, the values were too widely overlaped between the patients and the control to give diagnostic cutoff points. Conclusion:It seems that exercise QRS scores do not have additive diagnostic value for coronary artery disease. (Korean Circulation J 1999;29(6 :582-589",

        "tahun_terbit":2000,
        "abstrak":"Désiré Bourneville was born on 21 October 1840 in a small French village in Normandy called Garencières. He started his medical studies in Paris and became Resident of Paris hospitals in 1865. His principal teachers were Delasiauve and Charcot. In 1870 he submitted his doctoral thesis on clinical thermometry in brain diseases. At the same time he worked as a journalist for the Journal de Médecine Mentale and subsequently Mouvement Médical, Panthéon de l’Industrie, and Réveil. During the period of the Paris Commune he was active as a surgeon and did not take part in the political events but, courageously, took care of the wounded from both sides. Bourneville was the unofficial assistant to Charcot at Salpêtrière Hospital for about 10 years and played a major role in the description of hystero-epilepsia and in the publication of the Lessons of Charcot. In 1873 he founded the Progrès Médical, a major journal that spread of the ideas of Charcot and his school. In this journal Bourneville denounced the treachery of Bouchard at the time of the agrégation examination in 1892, when Babinski, a beloved pupil of Charcot was not elected, due to Bouchard’s hostility towards him. Consequently Babinski never became Professor in the Faculty of Medicine of Paris. Affiliated with Louis Blanc, Bourneville was elected to the City Council. Blanc was a publicist, historian, and famous socialist politician, particularly during the Revolution of 1848. During this period Bourneville actively developed a consistent hospital policy: secularizing the hospital founding a school for nurses, regulating midwifery in the Paris hospitals, and reforming the Médecins aliénistes examination. In 1879 he was appointed as Head of the Psychiatry Department of Bicêtre Hospital, which took care of epileptics and “idiots”. Within 10 years he had transformed this Department into a model service, where he developed his medicopedagogical treatment. Each year he published a volume of the Recherches cliniques sur l’épilepsie, l’hystérie et l’idiotisme as an exemplary activity report of a hospital department. In 1880 he founded the Archives de Neurologie. His scientific work was also very important: he identified and described the sclérose tubéreuse which kept his name, he related congenital myxoedema to the absence of thyroid gland, and described mongolism. He also continued his political career in the City Council and then as member of Parliament from 1883 to 1889 for the extreme left-wing party with the radicals. Bourneville died, poor, on 29 May 1909. In accordance with his will, an autopsy was performed on his body, and his body was cremated with civil funeral in the Père-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. A free-thinker, republican, radical, democrat, anticlericalist, and anticolonialist, all of Bourneville’s activities were inspired by deeply held convictions which gave them remarkable unity and continuity. For Bourneville, to be a republican and a physician was a single ideal.",

A negative resistor network with active elements is used to achieve the remote function of the DC cloak. Based on this network, the cloak can remotely generate a hidden region without distorting the currents far from the cloaked region. The experimental results show that any object in the hidden region is invisible to a DC detector. Our cloak does not require any knowledge of the hidden object.

Several books, which make for the theoretical backbone of this study, have been written on the subject of sharing beliefs, identifying with others and the consequences of this. The question being asked is whether Israel and the US actually share beliefs and, if so, which ones. The countries are being compared through two factors central to their national identity; nationalism and civilisation. The conclusion is that identity does matter in allianceformation, and has mattered in this particular alliance. However, it seems as though identity has played a more important role for one country than the other, and that is the US. Israel, being a less established country, can't afford to think about anything but security, and is therefore driven by realism.",

Methods Women with PCOS who underwent assisted reproductive technology (ART) from August, 2003 to December, 2007, were considered. A total of 336 women with PCOS were included in the study group and 1,003 infertile women who had tubal factor as an indication for ART were collected as controls. They were divided into four groups: a non-obese PCOS group, obese-PCOS group, non-obese tubal factor group, and obese tubal factor group, with obesity defined by a body mass index over 25 kg\/m2, and reviewed focusing on the basal characteristics, ART outcomes, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Results There was no difference among the groups' the clinical pregnancy rate or live birth rate. Regarding adverse pregnancy outcomes, the miscarriage rate, multiple pregnancy rate, and prevalence of preterm delivery and pregnancy induced hypertension were not different among the four groups. The incidence of small for gestational age infant was higher in the PCOS groups than the tubal factor groups (p<0.02). On the other hand, the morbidity of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was not high in the non-obese PCOS group but was in the obese groups. And in the obese PCOS group, the newborns were heavier than in the other groups (p<0.02). Conclusion Non-obese PCOS presents many differences compared with obese PCOS, not only in the IVF-parameters but also in the morbidity of adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially in GDM and fetal macrosomia.",

In the design calculation, the Monte Carlo transport calculation through thick shields has large statistical errors and the basic nuclear data and model used in the existing Monte Carlo codes are not well evaluated because of very few experimental data. It is therefore strongly needed to do the deep penetration experiment as shielding benchmark for investigating the calculation accuracy. Under this circumference, we performed the following two shielding experiments through concrete and iron, one with a 800 MeV proton accelerator of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), England and the other with a high energy heavy iron accelerator of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), Japan.

Materials and methods. The World Mental Health Survey in Peru used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, which provides diagnoses according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. It was performed with a multistage probabilistic sample in Lima, Arequipa, Huancayo, Iquitos and Chiclayo between July 2004 and December 2005. Results. The prevalence of mental disorders in the last twelve months was 13.5%, the most frequent being anxiety (7.9%), mood (3.5%), impulse control (3.5%) and substance misuse (1.7%). The widowed, separated and divorced showed a greater risk of disorders in the last year than those who were married or partners living together. Only 32.8% of those who had severe mental health disorders in the last twelve months received any kind of treatment. Among those with moderate or mild disorders, 18.1% and 15.4% received treatment, respectively. Conclusions. More than 13 out of 100 Peruvians reported having a mental health disorder in the last year. The magnitude of mental health disorders and the gap in those receiving care highlights the urgent need to direct care and resources towards the detection and timely treatment of mental diseases in Peru.",

This inflammatory state is not only characterized by infiltration of lipid laden macrophages, the hallmark cell of this disease, into the vascular wall, but also is characterized by the infiltration of a host of other inflammatory cells. The complex interaction of inflammatory cells with the normal residents of the vascular wall (ie, endothelial and smooth muscle cells) directs the progression of the disease. Inflammatory cells secrete a variety of chemokines and cytokines which have a profound effect on the development and progression of the plaque. Moreover, many of these cytokines can mediate both pro- and antiatherogenic processes depending on the cellular milieu. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamilies encompass numerous cytokines and receptors suggested to play a pivotal role in atherogenesis. Although many members of these families such as TNF-α and CD40 ligand and their putative receptors are considered to be proatherogenic,1–4 studies have also demonstrated an antiatherogenic role for others, including the p55 TNFR.5 TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and its putative receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), are also members of the TNF and TNFR superfamilies, respectively.

The Socialist Government with José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero at the helm (elected in March 2004) began to redirect Spanish foreign policy in new directions (the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq, the restoration of good relations with Morocco, Venezuela or Cuba and a shift away from Atlanticism to Europeanism). The foreign policy principles of this Government are: the return to the ‘heart of Europe’ (a closer relationship with France and Germany) and insistence on effective multilateralism, defence of democracy, human rights and respect for International Law. The current Government considers that Spain’s national interests will be better defended if the EU consolidates its role as a global actor, contributes to international peace and security, and guarantees the prevalence of an effective multilateralism in the international scene. Nevertheless, it is also worth noting that there are also elements of continuity between the current and the previous Governments in that the Socialist party has not altered longstanding Spanish foreign policy regional priorities: the Mediterranean region and Latin America. Furthermore, the fight against terrorism and the importance of the relationship with the US came to be included in the Spanish foreign policy agenda due to the international events after 9\/11 and the crisis in Iraq.",

Soil degradation under farming also inflicts off-site costs, through the processes of erosion, sedimentation, and leaching.\n\nThe on- and off-site impacts of soil degradation are part of the social cost of agricultural production in developing countries. However, these costs are routinely neglected by farmers and public planners, due to market and policy failures that mask the full cost of degradation to society. An important task for policy analysts and decision-makers is to identify the underlying causes of excessive soil degradation, to evaluate their economic significance, and to create incentives for less destructive land-use practices. Appropriate policies can help by making the full costs and benefits of alternative land-use practices more apparent to land users.

Herein, we report a new strategy for the fabrication of tough CHs with excellent conductivity, superior mechanical properties, and good biocompatibility by using chitosan framework as molecular templates for controlling conducting polypyrrole (PPy) nanorods in situ formation inside the hydrogel networks. First, polyacrylamide\/chitosan (CS) interpenetrating polymer network hydrogel was synthesized by UV photopolymerization; second, hydrophobic and conductive pyrrole monomers were absorbed and fixed on CS molecular templates and then polymerized with FeCl3 in situ inner hydrophilic hydrogel network. This strategy ensured that the hydrophobic PPy nanorods were uniformly distributed and integrated with the hydrophilic polymer phase to form highly interconnected conductive path in the hydrogel, endowing the hydrogel with high conductivity (0.3 S\/m). The CHs exhibited remarkable mechanical properties after the chelation of CS by Fe3+ and the formation of composites with the PPy nanorods (fracture energy 12 000 J m-2 and compression modulus 136.3 MPa). The use of a biopolymer molecular template to induce the formation of PPy nanostructures is an efficient strategy to achieve conductive multifunctional hydrogels.",

In contrast, studies produced mixed findings for effects of perceptual load on attention to emotional pictures. Emotional pictures can be phobic or nonphobic. Because phobia might be an evolutionary adaption, it is possible that effects of phobic pictures on attention differ from effects of nonphobic emotional pictures. The present thesis aimed at investigating attention in spider phobia. Attention to emotional pictures was operationalized as event-related potentials (ERPs) (P1, early posterior negativity [EPN,] and late positive potential [LPP]). Two research questions were formulated. First, do phobic pictures evoke larger ERPs than what can be expected from arousal and valence? Second, are effects of spatial attention and perceptual load on ERPs the same for phobic and nonphobic emotional pictures? To investigate this, phobic and nonphobic negative pictures were presented to spider phobic and nonphobic participants. To determine effects of spatial attention on ERPs, participants were instructed to divert attention to a single letter that was presented in the periphery. To determine effects of perceptual load on ERPs, participants were instructed to perform a letter discrimination task on one, two, or three letters that were presented in the periphery. Study 1 showed enhanced LPP amplitudes to phobic pictures independent of arousal and valence. Further, this effect was present in both phobic and nonphobic participants. Study 2 showed that there was no effect of perceptual load on LPP to phobic pictures. Study 3 showed that spatial attention reduced LPP amplitudes, and to a similar extent for both phobic and nonphobic pictures. Further, perceptual load did not reduce EPN or LPP amplitudes to either phobic or nonphobic pictures. To conclude, the results suggest that phobic pictures evoke larger ERP amplitudes than nonphobic pictures. Still, ERPs to phobic and nonphobic pictures are moderated similarly by spatial attention and perceptual load.",

Current therapeutic guidelines are based on clinical trials in which the number of females taking part is insufficient, and overall benefits are then dangerously extrapolated to women.\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT AND CONCLUSIONS\nStrokes in women have important features that distinguish them from those suffered by males, both as regards risk factors and aetiology, and in prevention and the therapeutic treatment that is performed during the fertile stage, pregnancy and menopause. There is, then, a need for further studies and specific clinical trials about strokes in females. Health professionals, society and the authorities, as well as women themselves, also need to be made more aware of the importance of strokes and to be provided with more information. If not, this epidemic will increase, especially if we bear in mind the foreseeable increase in life expectancy, and mortality and loss of independence in women will rise along with it.",

It is argued that there have been some policy adjustments, but that the housing sector has been able to hold its own reasonably well in the political arena. Public spending on housing as a percentage of the national budget since 1978 has risen. This is the result of the strong position of the interest groups in the non‐profit rent sector and — above all ‐of reasons situated outside housing itself: unemployment in the building trade, the relation between rent policy and incomes policy and the economic importance of urban restructuring processes. Housing held its own for non‐housing reasons.",

        "abstrak":"In this study, a structured survey questionnaire was used to determine consumers' preferences and behavior with regard to horse meat at a horse meat restaurant located in Jeju, Korea, from October 1 to December 24, 2005. The questionnaire employed in this study consisted of 20 questions designed to characterize six general attributes: horse meat sensory property, physical appearance, health condition, origin, price, and other attributes. Of the 1370 questionnaires distributed, 1126 completed questionnaires were retained based on the completeness of the answers, representing an 82.2% response rate. Two issues were investigated that might facilitate the search for ways to improve horse meat production and marketing programs in Korea. The first step was to determine certain important factors, called principal components, which enabled the researchers to understand the needs of horse meat consumers via principal component analysis. The second step was to define consumer segments with regard to their preferences for horse meat, which was accomplished via cluster analysis. The results of the current study showed that health condition, price, origin, and leanness were the most critical physical attributes affecting the preferences of horse meat consumers. Four segments of consumers, with different demands for horse meat attributes, were identified: origin-sensitive consumers, price-sensitive consumers, quality and safety-sensitive consumers, and non-specific consumers. Significant differences existed among segments of consumers in terms of age, nature of work, frequency of consumption, and general level of acceptability of horse meat.",

With new depth sensing technology such as Kinect providing high quality synchronized RGB and depth images (RGB-D data), combining the two distinct views for object recognition has attracted great interest in computer vision and robotics community. Recent methods mostly employ supervised learning methods for this new RGB-D modality based on the two feature sets. However, supervised learning methods always depend on large amount of manually labeled data for training models. To address the problem, this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning method to reduce the dependence on large annotated training sets. The method can effectively learn from relatively plentiful unlabeled data, if powerful feature representations for both the RGB and depth view can be extracted. Thus, a novel and effective feature termed CNN-SPM-RNN is proposed in this paper, and four representative features (KDES 1, CKM 2, HMP 3 and CNN-RNN 4) are evaluated and compared with ours under the unified semi-supervised learning framework. Finally, we verify our method on three popular and publicly available RGB-D object databases. The experimental results demonstrate that, with only 20% labeled training set, the proposed method can achieve competitive performance compared with the state of the arts on most of the databases.",

Each SPL is constructed to provide for the derivation of new products by covering a wide range of features in its domain. Nevertheless, over time, some domain features may become obsolete with the apparition of new features while others may become refined. Accordingly, the SPL must be maintained to account for the domain evolution. Such evolution requires a means for managing the impact of changes on the SPL models, including the feature model and design. This paper presents an automated method that analyzes feature model evolution, traces their impact on the SPL design, and offers a set of recommendations to ensure the consistency of both models. The proposed method defines a set of new metrics adapted to SPL evolution to identify the effort needed to maintain the SPL models consistently and with a quality as good as the original models. The method and its tool are illustrated through an example of an SPL in the Text Editing domain. In addition, they are experimentally evaluated in terms of both the quality of the maintained SPL models and the precision of the impact change management.",

First, studies on flow boiling heat transfer behaviours and mechanisms in microchannels are presented. Then, the available correlations and models of flow boiling heat transfer in micro-channels are reviewed and analysed. Comparisons of 12 correlations with a database covering a wide range of test parameters and 8 fluids are presented. It shows that all correlations poorly agree to the database. Furthermore, comparisons of the mechanistic flow boiling heat transfer models based on flow patterns including the Thome at al. three-zone heat transfer model for evaporation in microchannel and the flow pattern based model combining the Thome et al. three zone heat transfer models with the Cioncolini-Thome annular flow model for both macroand microchannel to the database are presented. It shows that the flow pattern based model combining the three zone model with the annular flow model gives better prediction than the three zone heat transfer model alone. The flow pattern based heat transfer model favourably agrees with the experimental database. According to the comparison and analysis, suggestions have been given for improving the prediction methods in the future. Furthermore, flow patterned based phenomenological models and their applications to micro channels are discussed. According to this comprehensive review and analysis of the current research on the flow boiling heat transfer mechanisms and prediction methods in micro-channels, the future research needs have been identified and recommended. In general, systematic and accurate experimental data of flow boiling heat transfer in micro-channels are still needed although a large amount of work has been done over the past decades. The channel size effect on the flow boiling behaviours should be systematically investigated. Heat transfer mechanisms in micro-channels should be further understood and related to the corresponding flow patterns. Furthermore, effort should be made to develop and improve generalised mechanistic prediction methods and theoretical models for flow boiling heat transfer in micro-channels according to the physical phenomena\/mechanisms and the corresponding flow structures. The effects of the channel size and a wide range of test conditions and fluid types should be considered in developing new prediction methods.",

The concept of credit-linked demand develops a new inventory model under two levels of trade credit policy. A solution procedure is presented to determine an optimal replenishment cycle and total cost per unit time. Results have been validated with relevant example. In a way, the proposed model provides a unique theory to reduce the deterioration rate under two levels of trade credit policy. With the help of sensitivity analysis, impact of various parameters on the cycle length and total cost has been discussed.",

Additionally, super-efficiency evaluation in DEA is a useful complementary analysis for ranking the performance of efficient DMUs. Although the literature has already considered a pioneering proposal for dealing with super-efficiency in SBM models, which may be referred to as Super-SBM, we extend this approach to the presence of undesirable outputs. We illustrate this contribution in three scenarios where super-efficiency SBM models with undesirable outputs may be of interest: (i) the analysis of productivity change; (ii) the provision of a full ranking of efficiency (also including efficient units); and (iii) the detection of influential units.

On the other hand, for a large class of cost functions (including all polynomials), the price of anarchy does converge to 1 in both heavy and light traffic conditions, and irrespective of the network topology and the number of O\/D pairs in the network.",

        "abstrak":"I n 1984, Australia introduced a universal taxpayer-funded health insurance system known as Medicare which offers subsidised private medical services and free public hospital care for all Australians. Its guiding principles are access, equity and universality. In the 1996-97 financial year, Federal Government spending on Medicare comprised $4.78 billion on public hospitals (State governments spent about as much again) and $6.07 billion on medical benefits.' A further $2.27 billion was spent on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.' Australia also has a well patronised private hospital system largely financed through private health insurance, which contributed $3.03 billion towards private hospital and medical services in 1996-97.2 Medicare appeals because it offers, in theory, universal access to high quality health and medical services at reasonable cost. It is criticised because (i) the demand for services under Medicare exceeds the Government's preparedness to pay (in the 1996-97 Budget, the Federal Government cut $2.8 billion over four years from Medicare expenditure), (ii) a lack of price signals for many services leads to poor efficiency in the allocation of health resources (with, for example, per-capita visits to general practitioners [GPs] increasing by 35% since Medicare's introduction,\" with no corresponding improvement in health outcome), (iii) access to many public hospital services (such as elective surgery) is increasingly rationed by waiting times,\" and (iv) there is a serious decline in private health financing as measured through private health insurance (data from Public Health Insurance Administration Council quarterly and annual reports). Those who use the private system relieve the pressure on the public health system. They receive a marginal benefit (quicker access) but pay a full premium; and they pay the Medicare levy, medical and hospital gaps, pharmaceuticals, prostheses and Federal and State taxes as well. A crisis is looming as unstoppable higher demand and availability of existing and emerging technologies, services and care practices meets immovable Government health spending and a decline in the private contribution to health expenditure. In this issue of the Journal, Harper offers some tantalising food for thought on future directions for health financing in Australia (page 286),5 but does his proposal offer any solution to the problem at the frontier? He seeks to retain many familiar elements: a major Federal Government role in funding health spending through taxation; fee-for-service remuneration, in the context of a system of scheduled fees; tax funding not to be applied to above-schedule charges; public hospitals funded under casemix. The institutions (the Health Insurance Commission, the National Health and Medical Research Council, Medical Boards, etc) would also look little different. In short, the rationing of publicly funded health services would be implemented as it is now through administered prices and approved Medical Benefits Scheme and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme schedules.",

Fifteen months after PBPC transplantation he had a molecular relapse. Despite discontinuation of CSA, the patient progressed into blast crisis 7 months later.

The performance of the parallel HDF5 approach is compared with a message passing interface-based approach and a brute-force approach.

By using an immunoassay based on functionalized Y 2 O 3 :Nd 3+ nanoparticles, where the excitation and emission processes in the Nd 3+ ion occur in the near-infrared (NIR) region, we have succeeded in eliminating the interferences from the biological fluorescence background, avoiding the use of time-resolved techniques.

        "tahun_terbit":2018,
        "abstrak":"Sequential delivery of biomolecules is very important as many biologics underlying injury and disease follow an orderly and sequenced series of events. Here we developed and introduced for the first time a dual compartment biomaterial system with an outer compartment made of gelatin and inner compartment that is a ferrogel which can be magnetically stimulated in order to provide on-demand, sequential delivery of multiple bio-instructive payload. We studied the potential application of this dual-compartment biomaterial system in different therapeutic contexts that may benefit from on-demand sequential deliveries, such as in cancer immunotherapy and in chronic wound healing. Chronic wounds can be a result of arrest in the inflammation phase of healing. Although inflammation critically initiates repair and helps clear infections, a prolonged inflammatory reaction can cause considerable harm to the injury site. After an appropriate duration of inflammation, this inflammatory response can be shifted to a more pro-healing response through the delivery of cytokines like interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). These anti-inflammatory cytokines alter the phenotype of macrophages from pro-inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2), suggesting a potentially powerful drug delivery strategy if these cytokines can be delivered in a delayed manner. We hypothesize that the transition of macrophage phenotype from proinflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2) can be controlled through sequenced delivery of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), followed by IL-4 and\/or IL-10. The goal of this research was to develop a wound-healing hydrogel system that initially delivers proinflammatory IFN-γ, followed by magnetically triggered delivery of pro-healing (antiinflammatory) IL-4 and\/or IL-10. Our biomaterial system was composed of twocompartments: (1) a porous gelatin outer compartment designed to recruit macrophages and establish an initial pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype, and (2) a magnetically responsive alginate inner compartment which was designed to deliver IL-4 and\/or IL-10 when magnetically triggered to shift the response to anti-inflammatory by promoting (M2) phenotype. We showed that we can have fast release of IFNg (Promotes M1 phenotype) and MCP-1 (recruits macrophages) initially from the outer compartment while holding on to IL4 and IL10 that is loaded in the ferrogel and have them burst release when applying the magnetic field. Biomaterial-based cancer immunotherapy strategies require materials capable of recruiting dendritic cells (DCs) and reprogramming them with cancer antigen and danger signal. This strategy requires the implantation of a biomaterial that is loaded with DC recruitment factors, danger signals, and cancer antigen. This co-delivery of danger signal and antigen results in DC activation and homing of cancer-antigen-presenting DCs to the lymph nodes, subsequently triggering an anti-tumor immune response from the host. However, danger signals and antigen diffuse out of the biomaterial while DCs are being actively recruited to the biomaterial. This may result in lower concentrations of these necessary reprogramming agents by the time DCs are recruited and consequently, lower quantities of activated DCs, and a reduced anti-tumor immune response. It is possible that sequential release of DC recruitment and reprogramming factors will enhance the number of reprogrammed DCs over simultaneous release, leading to improved anti-cancer immune responses. In order to test this, a material system with unique delivery capabilities must be developed. Therefore, we designed a biomaterial system capable of first recruiting DCs by initially releasing DC recruitment factors from outer compartment. This biomaterial can deliver reprogramming agents (i.e., cancer antigen) when magnetically stimulated only after a substantial population of DCs has been recruited. The results showed that we were able to deliver GM-CSF (DC recruitment factor) initially from the outer compartment followed by delivering HSP27 (model cancer antigen) when stimulated in the magnetic field",

        "abstrak":"0 CCASIONALLY a chance observation jump-starts a whole field of science. The discovery of immune tolerance and the recognition of self and nonself is such an event. It started with a 1944 letter from a cattle breeder in Maryland to the University of Wisconsin immunogenetics laboratory, reporting a curious pair of twin calves, unusual in having different fathers. RAY OWEN, a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory and already interested in blood groups of cattle twins, thought they would provide an interesting opportunity for blood group analysis, so blood samples were sent to him. In the thirties and forties, the genetics of blood cell antigens was an active field for investigation. It was then a popular view among geneticists that antigens, because of their simple inheritance, might be immediate gene products. For this reason, they might provide an insight into the nature of that maddeningly elusive entity, the gene. In pursuit of this possibility, new blood types were actively sought in various species, including Homo supiens and Bos taurus. By the early 1940s, 40 different antigenic specificities had been identified in cattle. The world leader in cattle blood groups was the immunogenetics laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, founded by L. J. COLE and M. R. IRWIN (OWEN 1989). There was sometimes uncertainty about paternity in cattle, and when valuable animals were involved, that could be an important economic issue. Breeders and breed associations welcomed blood groups as a foolproof way of identifjmg sires. The immunogenetics laboratory provided valuable information and the breed associations provided financial support, vitally important in those pre-NIH\/NSF days. It was a win-win situation. The events that led to the letter involved a Guernsey cow with twin calves. She had been properly mated to a Guernsey bull, but shortly afterward a lustful Hereford escaped from a neighboring area and got into the act. The color patterns of the calves showed clearly that the twins had different fathers. Blood analysis revealed that the COW carried (among many others) antigen G. The Guernsey bull had antigens S and X2, while the Hereford bull had R and 1’.",

But with a lack of relevant research done in these countries about the introduction of technologies like information systems there is not much to go by. This research will therefore be done in support of the belief that a convincing and operational framework for assessing health system performance is vital for the work of governments, development agencies and multilateral institutions. The international Institute for Communication and Development (IICD) works in 9 countries in Africa and Latin America. IICD has since 1998 been supporting partner organizations with the introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for development and poverty alleviation, amongst others in the health sector. For the past years they have been supporting projects in Mali, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia implementing systems into healthcare. IICD sees the importance of a decentralized system for health information management and wants to take stock of the achievements of projects that have been implementing information systems, gather experiences and lessons learnt and identify challenges for introducing and using information system (IS) in healthcare. This is why together with IICD this research wants to identify the issues that have to be considered when implementing information systems in the form of a health management information system in hospitals on the district level in the countries supported by IICD.

However, determining their cooling ages requires the knowledge of their effective temperatures, masses, radii and atmospheric composition. So far, these parameters could only be inferred for a small number of ultracool white dwarfs for which an accurate distance is known, by fitting their spectral energy distributions in conjunction with a theoretical mass–radius relation. However, the mass–radius relation remains largely untested, and the derived cooling ages are hence model dependent. Here we report direct measurements of the mass and radius of an ultracool white dwarf in the double-lined eclipsing binary SDSS J013851.54−001621.6. We find MWD = 0.529 ± 0.010 M⊙ and RWD = 0.0131 ± 0.0003 R⊙. Our measurements are consistent with the mass–radius relation and we determine a robust cooling age of 9.5 billion years for the 3570 K white dwarf. We find that the mass and radius of the low-mass companion star, Msec = 0.132 ± 0.003 M⊙ and Rsec = 0.165 ± 0.001 R⊙, are in agreement with evolutionary models. We also find evidence that this >9.5 Gyr old M5 star is still active, far beyond the activity lifetime for a star of its spectral type. This is likely caused by the high tidally enforced rotation rate of the star. The companion star is close to filling its Roche lobe and the system will evolve into a cataclysmic variable in only 70 Myr. Our direct measurements demonstrate that this system can be used to calibrate ultracool white dwarf atmospheric models.",

        "tahun_terbit":2015,
        "abstrak":"ABSTRACT JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) infection of immunocompromised individuals results in the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The viral capsid of JCPyV is composed primarily of the major capsid protein virus protein 1 (VP1), and pentameric arrangement of VP1 monomers results in the formation of a pore at the 5-fold axis of symmetry. While the presence of this pore is conserved among polyomaviruses, its functional role in infection or assembly is unknown. Here, we investigate the role of the 5-fold pore in assembly and infection of JCPyV by generating a panel of mutant viruses containing amino acid substitutions of the residues lining this pore. Multicycle growth assays demonstrated that the fitness of all mutants was reduced compared to that of the wild-type virus. Bacterial expression of VP1 pentamers containing substitutions to residues lining the 5-fold pore did not affect pentamer assembly or prevent association with the VP2 minor capsid protein. The X-ray crystal structures of selected pore mutants contained subtle changes to the 5-fold pore, and no other changes to VP1 were observed. Pore mutant pseudoviruses were not deficient in assembly, packaging of the minor capsid proteins, or binding to cells or in transport to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum. Instead, these mutant viruses were unable to expose VP2 upon arrival to the endoplasmic reticulum, a step that is critical for infection. This study demonstrated that the 5-fold pore is an important structural feature of JCPyV and that minor modifications to this structure have significant impacts on infectious entry. IMPORTANCE JCPyV is an important human pathogen that causes a severe neurological disease in immunocompromised individuals. While the high-resolution X-ray structure of the major capsid protein of JCPyV has been solved, the importance of a major structural feature of the capsid, the 5-fold pore, remains poorly understood. This pore is conserved across polyomaviruses and suggests either that these viruses have limited structural plasticity in this region or that this pore is important in infection or assembly. Using a structure-guided mutational approach, we showed that modulation of this pore severely inhibits JCPyV infection. These mutants do not appear deficient in assembly or early steps in infectious entry and are instead reduced in their ability to expose a minor capsid protein in the host cell endoplasmic reticulum. Our work demonstrates that the 5-fold pore is an important structural feature for JCPyV.",

However, there has been little exploration of the key elements of structure that promote greater levels of functioning and emotional\/behavioural stability and how these elements are optimally integrated within the infrastructure of a rehabilitation service.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe nature of structure and why it is helpful is explored initially. Thereafter, the processes involved in transition from externally supported structure to the client 'self-structuring' are described. The infrastructure for facilitating these transitional processes are considered in terms of the design of services for systemic neurorehabilitation encompassing environmental factors (e.g. living environments, vocational and recreational options, step-up services and social milieus), therapeutic alliances (rehabilitation professionals, family, friends), organisational structures (service delivery, rehabilitation coaching, transdisciplinary teams) and rehabilitation philosophies and practice.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt is concluded that the process of supporting individuals to transition from the 'structure' of the environment and other people towards self-structuring skills is a critical process in rehabilitation. This is reliant upon a comprehensive and robust organisational infrastructure that can successfully and flexibly integrate the core elements of structure across a transitional pathway towards increased independence and self-structuring.",

        "abstrak":"Data often comes in the form of an array or matrix. Matrix factorization techniques attempt to recover missing or corrupted entries by assuming that the matrix can be written as the product of two low-rank matrices. In other words, matrix factorization approximates the entries of the matrix by a simple, fixed function---namely, the inner product---acting on the latent feature vectors for the corresponding row and column. Here we consider replacing the inner product by an arbitrary function that we learn from the data at the same time as we learn the latent feature vectors. In particular, we replace the inner product by a multi-layer feed-forward neural network, and learn by alternating between optimizing the network for fixed latent features, and optimizing the latent features for a fixed network. The resulting approach---which we call neural network matrix factorization or NNMF, for short---dominates standard low-rank techniques on a suite of benchmark but is dominated by some recent proposals that take advantage of the graph features. Given the vast range of architectures, activation functions, regularizers, and optimization techniques that could be used within the NNMF framework, it seems likely the true potential of the approach has yet to be reached.",

        "abstrak":"PurposeThe precise mechanism and pathological role of postlaminectomy\/laminotomy fibrosis (PLF) in postoperative neurological deficits have not been established. Many studies use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to prove that there is no consistent correlation between PLF and postoperative neurological deficits and back pain (PNDBP). Therefore, we assumed that the direct-compression effect may not be the only factor but that other neurological deficits associated with pathological mechanisms should exist and need more investigation. The purpose of this study was to compare over time the differences and changes in histopathological properties of PLF in rats.MethodsWe used a rat model with walking-track analysis for neurologic evaluation, grading scale to evaluate PLF, histomorphometric measurements of dura sac diameter, and histological tissue reactions (dura mater and spinal rootlets) juxtaposed to the postlaminectomy\/laminotomy defect. The 54 adult Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into laminotomy (n = 18), laminectomy (n = 18), and sham-operation groups (n = 18). All groups were subdivided into three equal subgroups based on different postoperative time points (1, 2, and 3 months). All sections of vertebral column were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with Masson’s trichrome.ResultsThe results showed that only a slight compression effect reflected by nonsignificant changes in the maximum anterior-posterior diameters within the dura sac, in the walking tract test, and increased grades of PLF over time. In addition, significant pathological inflammatory changes, such as thickening of the dura mater, axonal swelling, and neovascularization, were found in the post-laminectomy\/laminotomy groups at each time point.ConclusionLaminectomy-\/laminotomy-related inflammation may lead to PLF, and these pathological changes may be the main cause of postoperative neurological deficits. These findings show that research on preventing PLF should include perioperative modulation of inflammatory reactions induced by laminectomy\/laminotomy.",

Methods 8,892 participants aged 20–60 years in 2010–2011 were analyzed. Six obesity indices were examined: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-height ratio (WHtR), waist-hip ratio (WHR), log of the sum of triceps and subscapular skin fold thickness (LTS), and percent body fat derived from bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). We estimated models with obesity indices specified as deciles and as continuous linear variables to predict prevalent hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol and report associations (prevalence ratios, PRs), discrimination (area-under-the-curve, AUCs), and calibration (index χ2). We also examined a composite unhealthy cardiovascular profile score summarizing glucose, lipids, and blood pressure. Results No single obesity index consistently performed statistically significantly better than the others across the outcome models. Based on point estimates, WHtR trended towards best performance in classifying diabetes (PR = 1.58 [1.45–1.72], AUC = 0.77, men; PR = 1.59 [1.47–1.71], AUC = 0.80, women) and hypertension (PR = 1.34 [1.26,1.42], AUC = 0.70, men; PR = 1.41 [1.33,1.50], AUC = 0.78, women). WC (mean difference = 0.24 SD [0.21–0.27]) and WHtR (mean difference = 0.24 SD [0.21,0.28]) had the strongest associations with the composite unhealthy cardiovascular profile score in women but not in men. Conclusions WC and WHtR were the most useful indices for identifying South Asian adults with prevalent diabetes and hypertension. Collection of waist circumference data in South Asian health surveys will be informative for population-based CVD surveillance efforts.",

        "abstrak":"Abstract X-irradiation of single crystals of 2′-deoxyuridine (UdR) between 8 K and room temperature gives rise to a variety of different radical structures, seven of which are described here. The dominant low-temperature species are the π ∗ anion on the uracil base and alkoxy radicals. The former is characterized by the usual α-proton interaction at C6(−1.24, −0.83, −2.1 mT) but displays additional interactions with the nitrogens on N1 and N3. For the alkoxy radicals, there is marked variability in structures yielding two primary and one secondary species. Upon warming, an α-hydroxy alkyl radical at C5′ of the deoxyribose grows in showing an a coupling (−0.84, −1.42, −2.36 mT), a β interaction (3.1 mT) and an exchangeable OH coupling ∼0.3 mT). Upon irradiation at room temperature, a 5-yl and a 6-yl radical are the main radical centers both formed by net gain of a hydrogen at the 6 and 5 position of the base, respectively. Besides an a coupling, the former species shows inequivalent β protons (3.9, 4.9 mT) and interaction with the N3H group. The 6-yl radical has equivalent β couplings of 3.3 mT. Storage of crystals for several months at 300 K results in loss of both 5- and 6-yl radicals and formation of two different species, one characterized by two β-type interactions (4.2, 1.8 mT) and one exhibiting an α-type coupling (−0.53, −1.88, −0.98 mT). Tentative assignments for these species are given and the solid-state radiation chemistry of uracil derivatives with respect to nucleic acid radiation damage is discussed.",

When strikes occur, distrust and antagonisms are engendered which persist after the strikes are over. Strikes, too, curtail production. A strike in one plant often causes work stoppages in other plants where industrial peace prevails. Strikes cause employees to lose wages which they may never recover even though they gain increases in their rates of pay. Strikes upset the economy of the communities in which they occur. The \"butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker\" lose business if the striking employees cannot buy. Strikes weaken the finances of the companies in which they occur. Stockholders face possible reductions in their dividends. Strikes, particularly in the basic industries and utilities, jeopardize the rights of the public. The cutting off of electricity, gas, transportation, milk, and fuel are serious matters. Strikes and other forms of industrial strife must give way to industrial peace. But we cannot countenance industrial peace \"at any price.\" Industrial peace must not be gained at the expense of our democratic way of life, nor by the abandonment of our American free enterprise system. Industrial peace must be achieved by democratic means, in some countries industrial strife has been outlawed but only through the compulsion of autocratic government. While we recognize the evils of industrial strife, we have not clearly identified the underlying causes. I shall endeavor to throw some illumination upon the causes, as I see them, by reference to outstanding eveners and developments in the period of about 30 years which commenced with the First World War.

Under diverse conditions, the program’s performance is evaluated by comparison with high-resolution manual analysis of action potential duration, MAP detection, baseline and plateau determination. For each variable, the differences between both forms of analysis are categorised according to species (rabbit, dog or baboon), intervention (control, sematilide or LY-190147), rhythm source (sinus or paced), and rates. They are then examined using ANOVA (null hypothesis: no difference between methods for any category). Intra-group differences are significant for baseline selection (p<0.05), and treatment effects are significant (p<0.05) for one species (baboon). However, the differences found are negligible when compared with expected measurement errors. Thus the program reliably detects and accurately analyses MAPs, independent of species, drug or pacing. The program’s strength is its use of simple heuristic algorithms to identify and profile MAP signals while rejecting spurious transients. These algorithms focus on the procedural aspects of automatic MAP detection and validation, with minimum use of complex mathematics. The program’s estimated throughput exceeds 8200 MAPs min−1 on a 50 MHz i486 DX machine.

The outcome variables were visual acuity, control of inflammation, reduction of macular edema, tapering of immunosuppressive therapy, and adverse effects.\n Results The follow-up period ranged from 16 to 36 months (mean ± SD, 23 ± 7.4 months). The number of infliximab infusions ranged from 10 to 23 (14 ± 4.6). By the 2-month follow-up, all patients had achieved remission, the cystoid macular edema had resolved, and visual acuity had improved dramatically. Throughout the follow-up period, three patients remained attack-free. One patient had one relapse, and another patient had two relapses before the scheduled infusions; all three relapses resolved rapidly after the subsequent infusion. One patient developed five relapses, and infusions at 6-week intervals were necessary to achieve sustained remission. At the end of the follow-up period, visual acuity improved in five patients. Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy was substantially reduced. Antinuclear antibodies developed in two patients who received 17 and 23 infusions.

The correlation filter and mathematical morphology algorithm is combined to enhance the signal energy and evaluate slowly varying background noise. The star point can be separated from most types of noise in this manner, making extraction and recognition easier. Partial image differentiation is then utilized to obtain the motion parameters from only one image of the star tracker based on the above process. Considering the motion model, the reference window is adopted to perform centroid determination.

In this paper, we propose power over CAN (PoCAN), which is an implementation method of power over data lines (PoDL) under the review in IEEE P802.3bu, for twisted-pair (TP) cables among CAN devices to remove power lines. Unipolar non-return-to-zero (NRZ) line codes are employed in CAN and include mainly direct current (DC) component in the signals so that power superposed unipolar NRZ codes will not be suitable for PoDL. Bipolar alternate make inversion (AMI) and NRZ line codes are exploited for PoCAN because AMI-NRZ codes do not include DC component. The waveforms of PoCAN are analyzed in bus networks complied by a CAN standard with an analog mixed-signal (AMS) simulator. Moreover, experimental trials are conducted to evaluate frame transmission of PoCAN. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed PoCAN can achieve the simultaneous transmission of data and DC power in one-pair TP cables.",

More specifically, by seeking to strategically include often-subjugated types of knowledge and by focusing on redistributing epistemic power to agents that typically have been excluded from epistemic participation in contemporary yoga therapy research, the social work discipline, with its strong commitment to social justice, has the potential to contribute to filling an important gap in scientific literature. We begin by presenting the relevance of the social work perspective in relation to the field of yoga therapy. We next offer a reserved critical analysis of the dominant technical knowledge base that currently informs yoga therapy practice. This analysis highlights the social parameters that may be rendered invisible or left aside when adopting a positivist epistemological lens and justifies how the conceptual apparatus of epistemic responsibility serves as a potential platform for rethinking social work's position and future contributions to the field of yoga therapy. Finally, we mobilize the concept of cultural appropriation to illustrate how striving for epistemic responsibility provides an entry point for addressing the multilevel, complex social processes embedded in yoga therapy practice and research while aiming to capture the many voices-and hence the various truths-implicated in a democratic, reflexive, and inclusive research process.",

To determine whether insulin is adsorbed on a liquid\/air interface, the influence of foam in vials of radiolabeled insulin was evaluated. Using a bag-to-bag transfer method, the influence of regular insulin and detergent on radiotracer insulin binding was assessed. To evaluate the reversibility of the binding, bag pieces with bound radioactive insulin were washed with distilled water, detergent, and left to soak in detergent before measuring radioactivity. The radiolabeled insulin was adsorbed in the foam and then released into the bulk of the solution when the foam disappeared; hence, insulin can be entrapped in a liquid\/air interface. The addition of regular insulin decreased the binding of the radiotracer insulin to the bag walls. The bound insulin could be removed by washing with water and detergent, but soaking in detergent did not remove a small residual quantity of the bound insulin, suggesting that minimal chemical binding or diffusion of the insulin into the plastic may occur. Insulin binding to plastic bags primarily follows the physical laws of adsorption.",

For human RVA strains, the number of complete genome data have grown exponentially. However, there is still a lack of complete genome data on porcine RVA strains. Recently, G9 RVA strains have been identified as the third most important genotype in diarrheic pigs in South Korea in combinations with P[7] and P[23]. This study is the first report on complete genome analyses of 1 G9P[7] and 3 G9P[23] porcine RVA strains, resulting in the following genotype constellation: G9-P[7]\/P[23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1. By comparisons of these genotype constellations, it was revealed that the Korean G9P[7] and G9P[23] RVA strains possessed a typical porcine RVA backbone, similar to other known porcine RVA strains. However, detailed phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of intra-genotype reassortments among porcine RVA strains in South Korea. Thus, our data provide genetic information of G9 RVA strains increasingly detected in both humans and pigs, and will help to establish the role of pigs as a source or reservoir for novel human RVA strains.",

As the first known structures of a GH-42 enzyme, we determined the crystal structures of free and galactose-bound A4-beta-Gal at 1.6A and 2.2A resolution, respectively. A4-beta-Gal forms a homotrimeric structure resembling a flowerpot. Each monomer has an active site located inside a large central tunnel. The N-terminal domain of A4-beta-Gal has a TIM barrel fold, as predicted from hydrophobic cluster analysis. The putative catalytic residues of A4-beta-Gal (Glu141 and Glu312) superimpose well with the catalytic residues of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. The environment around the catalytic nucleophile (Glu312) is similar to that in the case of E.coli beta-galactosidase, but the recognition mechanism for a substrate is different. Trp182 of the next subunit of the trimer constitutes a part of the active-site pocket, indicating that the trimeric structure is essential for the enzyme activity. Structural comparison with other glycoside hydrolases revealed that many features of the 4\/7 superfamily are conserved in the A4-beta-Gal structure. On the basis of the results of 1H NMR spectroscopy, A4-beta-Gal was determined to be a \"retaining\" enzyme. Interestingly, the active site was similar with those of retaining enzymes, but the overall fold of the TIM barrel domain was very similar to that of an inverting enzyme, beta-amylase.",

The fragment-fragment correlation data show that the majority of events arises from a binary-decay process with a relatively large multiplicity of secondary light-charged particles emitted by the two primary excited fragments in the exit channel. No evidence is observed for ternary-breakup processes, as expected from the systematics recently established for incident energies below 15 MeV\/nucleon and for a large number of reactions.

Prediction was performed with the following models: decision tree, random forest, multiple logistic regression, and support vector machine. The accuracy of the models was evaluated by the kappa index (K), general accuracy (GA), and class accuracy. The prediction models were sensitive to the disproportionate sampling of soil classes.

Here, we evaluated seasonal variations in microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) as well as microbial activity (as qCO 2 ) for 16 months with respect to several factors relating to soil moisture and nutrients under different land management practices (plant residue application, fertilizer application) in both clayey (38% clay) and sandy (4% clay) croplands in Tanzania. We observed that MBC and MBN tended to decrease during the rainy season whereas they tended to increase and remain at high levels during the dry season in all treatment plots at both of our test sites, although soil moisture did not correlate with MBC or MBN. qCO 2 correlated with soil moisture in all treatment plots at both sites, and hence soil microbes act as decomposers mainly during the rainy season. Although the effect of seasonal variation of soil moisture on the dynamics of MBC, MBN, and qCO 2 was certainly greater than that attributable to plant residue application, fertilizer application, or soil texture, plant residue application early in the rainy season clearly increased MBC and MBN in both clayey and sandy soils. This suggests that plant residue application can help to not only counter the N loss caused by leaching but also synchronize crop N uptake and N release from soil microbes by utilizing these microbes as an ephemeral nutrient pool during the early crop growth period. We also found substantially large seasonal variations in MBC and MBN, continuously high qCO 2 , and rapid turnover of soil microbes in sandy soil compared to clayey soil. Taken together, our results indicate that soil microbes, acting as both a nutrient pool and decomposers, have a more substantial impact on tropical sandy soil than on clayey soil.",

        "abstrak":"Surveillance of interval cancers (IC) provides a measure of breast screening efficacy. Increased breast density is a predictor of breast cancer risk and of the risk of IC in screening. Improving screening sensitivity in women with dense breasts, through adjunct ultrasound (US), may potentially reduce IC; however this has not been proven. We report on first-year IC in a retrospective cohort of 8865 women who had 19,728 screening examinations (2001-2006): women with non-dense (D1-D2) breasts received mammography (M) screening, and women with dense (D3-D4) breasts also received ultrasound. Data linkage with both hospital discharge records and cancer registry databases was used to identify IC. Underlying cancer rates (cancers observed within 1-year from screening) were 6.3\/1000 screens in the D1-D2 group and 8.3\/1000 screens in the D3-D4 group. Cancer detection rate (CDR) was 5.98\/1000 in all screening examinations; in D3-D4 breasts ultrasound had an additional CDR of 4.4\/1000 screens. There were 21 first-year IC, an overall interval cancer rate (ICR) of 1.07\/1000 negative screens: 0.95\/1000 in women < 50 years and 1.16\/1000 screens in women ≥ 50 years. ICR by breast density were 1.0\/1000 negative screens in D1-D2, and 1.1\/1000 negative screens in D3-D4. Interval cancers were early stage (in situ or small invasive) cancers, almost all were node-negative. Screening sensitivity was 83.5% for mammography alone in D1-D2 breasts relative to 86.7% for mammography with ultrasound in D3-D4 breasts. Our study shows that including ultrasound as adjunct screening in women with D3-D4 breasts brings the IC rate to similar levels as IC in non-dense breasts--this suggests that additional cancer detection by ultrasound is likely to improve screening benefit in dense breasts, and supports the implementation of a randomised trial of adjunct ultrasound in women with increased breast tissue density.",

We approach the problem by learning morphological characteristics of structures of interest in each sub-volume to understand global alignment transformations. Based on the observations of morphology, sub-volumes are aligned by connecting the morphological features at the sub-volume boundaries by minimizing morphological discontinuity. To minimize the discontinuity, we introduce three morphological discontinuity metrics: discontinuity magnitude at sub-volume boundary points, and overall and junction discontinuity residuals after polynomial curve fitting to multiple aligned sub-volumes. The proposed techniques have been applied to the problem of aligning CLSM sub-volumes acquired from four consecutive physical cross sections.

Structure-affinity relationships (SARs) of non-peptide CRF antagonists suggest that such antagonists can be constructed of three units: a hydrophobic unit (Up-Area), a proton accepting unit (Central-Area), and an aromatic unit (Down-Area). Our interest focused on the Up-Area in deriving the novel methylidenepiperidine derivatives 8-10 and 4-aryl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine derivatives 11-13 as non-peptide CRF1 receptor antagonists. Compounds 8a and 11a had moderate affinity for CRF1 receptor, but compounds 9, 10, 12 and 13 did not exhibit CRF1 receptor affinity. Modification of derivatives 11 afforded compounds 11i (CRA1001) and 11x (CRA1000), which had high affinity and selectivity for CRF1 receptors with potent anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like properties in some experimental animal models. These findings suggest that the hydrophonic unit (Up-Area) may be useful for design of CRF1 antagonists. We report here the design, synthesis and SARs of the derivatives 8 and 11 and isosteres 9, 10, 12 and 13.",

Local heat transfer coefficient during rotation is determined by employing a thermochromic liquid crystal. Effects of the Coriolis force and the centrifugal buoyancy force have been examined by comparing the heat transfer coefficient with different free-stream velocities, rotational speeds and wall temperatures. It has been revealed that the Coriolis force has significant effect on transitional heat transfer, while its effect on turbulent heat transfer is moderate. The centrifugal buoyancy exhibits additional effects if the thermal loading is high.",

Fortunately, it is preventable by detecting precancerous lesions and by various screening tools for early invasive cancers. Screening can be possible if women are aware of the problem. Despite the existence of effective screening using Pap smear, the uptake of screening is poor. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the awareness and practice regarding cervical cancer screening among women visiting tertiary hospital. Methodology: A descriptive cross – sectional study was conducted to assess the awareness and practice regarding cervical cancer screening among women attending in gynaecological outpatient department of Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital. A total of one hundred and fifty two women were selected purposively for the study. Structured questionnaire was designed and data collection was done through face to face interview technique during the period of September to November 2018. The collected data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Science version 20. Results: Among 152 respondents, majority of the respondents (59.2%) were aware that multiple sexual partners is one of the risk factors of cervical cancer. 38.8% were aware that cervical cancer can be prevented by regular cervical screening. Majority of the respondents: 152 (44.7%) had given correct response regarding meaning of cervical cancer screening and 42.8% were aware of Pap smear test for cervical screening. Only 31.6% had performed cervical cancer screening at least once. Overall mean percentage knowledge was 3.08 with SD 0.96.There was weak correlation between knowledge and practice. Conclusion: This study concluded that majority of respondents had inadequate knowledge and practice regarding cervical cancer screening. Thus, cervical cancer screening health camps and awareness program should be conducted at community to national level for women, to increase the level of knowledge and practice regarding cervical cancer screening.",

It was decided to do the tests only on poplar (Populus spp.) to reduce a part of the typical wood variability, while poplar was chosen because it is widely present in Italian heritage, such as panel paintings, statues and furniture, and these objects cannot be dated by dendrochronology; also because 14C methodology has major limitations. Poplar artefacts from the fourteenth to the nineteenth century were selected, dated by means of documents, by attributions, or stylistically. In addition, recent poplar samples were selected as a reference. Wood flour were taken from the selected samples, discarding the surface layers that could have been influenced by oxidation phenomena. Before taking measurements with FT-IR, the wood meal was dried and the chemical extractives were removed. The results show the presence of a time-related trend, but the time factor is certainly not the only one that causes the variations within the spectra. After a discussion, it is therefore considered that the results do not allow at the current state to definitely produce a reliable reference for dating poplar wood artefacts through this methodology.",

        "abstrak":"The increasing deployment of variable renewables and parallel residential space heat electrification using heat pumps poses two significant challenges for electricity systems: First, coincidence of certain weather events can stress the power system due to the increasing weather-dependence on both supply and demand side; Secondly, increased net load demand requires large capacity expansion unless heat and electricity can be partially decoupled. This paper proposes a planning methodology to explore these challenges by integrating a ‘Resistance-Capacitance’ representation of building thermodynamics into an integrated planning model. This enables analysis of coincidental weather effects which drive system adequacy and of the potential to utilise building thermal inertia to pre-heat the building and effectively store electricity in the form of heat according to system conditions. The model was tested with a case study for the Irish energy system in 2030. It was found that different weather patterns considerably influence investment and planning choices. Also, coincidental effects of different weather variables – in this case, low temperatures and low wind speed - define the most critical situations in terms of adequacy. By utilising building thermal inertia, total system costs of residential heat electrification can be reduced to the level of the benchmark technology, gas boilers.",

        "abstrak":"Growing observational evidence has suggested active meteorology in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs (BDs) and directly imaged extrasolar giant planets (EGPs). In particular, a number of surveys have shown that near-infrared brightness variability is common among L and T dwarfs. Despite the likelihood from previous studies that atmospheric dynamics is the major cause of the variability, the detailed mechanism of the variability remains elusive, and we need to seek a natural, self-consistent mechanism. Clouds are important in shaping the thermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres via their opacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this work, using a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a self-consistent coupling between the thermal structure, convective mixing, cloud radiative heating\/cooling, and condensation\/evaporation of clouds, we show that radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in both temperature and cloud structure under conditions appropriate for BDs and directly imaged EGPs. The typical periods of variability are 1 to tens of hr, with a typical amplitude of the variability up to hundreds of K in effective temperature. The existence of variability is robust over a wide range of parameter space, but the detailed evolution of the variability is sensitive to model parameters. Our novel, self-consistent mechanism has important implications for the observed flux variability of BDs and directly imaged EGPs, especially for objects whose variability evolves on short timescales. It is also a promising mechanism for cloud breaking, which has been proposed to explain the L\/T transition of BDs.",

Over this interval, stroke mortality rates declined dramatically with convergence of age-adjusted, state-specific stroke rates both within and between the various race-gender groups. For each race-gender group, high age-adjusted stroke mortality rates were significantly clustered in the southeastern United States, particularly in the South Atlantic census division, with persistent extreme rates in Georgia and the Carolinas. For whites, low-rate states were concentrated in the Mountain census division and along the northern Atlantic coast. The nonrandom distribution of stroke mortality across the United States, the large magnitude of the difference between high- and low-rate areas, the persistence of the pattern over more than four decades, the similarity of the distribution for different race-gender groups, the lack of delimitation by administrative or political boundaries, and results of national cooperative studies completed in the late 1960s and early 1970s together suggest that the pattern of excess stroke mortality is not an artifact of different diagnostic and reporting practices.

This paper compares two methods to reduce the impact of fish on charophyte establishment in this water body. \n \n2. \nA 1 ha compartment of the lake was partitioned off and intensively fished by conventional netting methods. A total of 5115 fish, total weight 451 kg, was removed from the compartment over 17 months. Allowing for growth and reproduction within the sampling period, intensive netting reduced the original fish biomass by 86% from about 200 to 28 kg ha−1. \n \n3. \nCatfish (Ameiurus nebulosus Le Sueur) comprised 74% of the fish numbers and 57% of the fish biomass. Perch (Perca fluviatilis L.), shortfinned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus L.), tench (Tinca tinca L.), and goldfish (Carassius auratus L.) were present, in order of reducing abundance. These species are alien to New Zealand, with the exception of shortfinned eel. \n \n4. \nCharophytes were transplanted inside and outside of the fished 1 ha compartment and their subsequent survival and establishment was monitored. Despite the extensive fish removal from the 1 ha compartment, repeat transplants inside it did not establish in the long term. \n \n5. \nOutside of the 1 ha compartment, charophytes were also transplanted into nine 6.25-m2 fish exclosures with netting sides to establish ‘founder colonies’ of charophytes. Within these small exclosures, charophytes established (⩾75% cover) within 1 yr; when five of the exclosures were removed, these unprotected plants survived and expanded over the next year. \n \n6. \nThis study shows that small exclosures can be used to establish founder colonies of charophytes in the presence of herbivorous and benthivorous fish, and that intensive fish removal is likely to be a less successful and more costly method to restore charophytes in lakes. \n \n \n \nCopyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The accurate and rapid assessment, screening correctly of patients leaded to appropriate treatment, timely and complication reduction. This study aimed to develop a Clinical Nursing Practice Guideline (CNPG) for the patients with acute ischemic stroke. The IOWA Model of evidence-based practice to promote quality care was used as a framework of this study. The practice guideline was developed based on relevant studies and related evidence from the database Institute of Electrical including Blackwell, CINAHL, ProQuest, PubMed and Science direct. Nine researches applied to study from 2004-2014 were selected for possible utilization. Among these studies, one of them was level of evidence I, four of them were level of evidence III, and four were level of evidence IV. The guideline was validated by four experts and was corrected at the parts of assessment method, nursing management in the patient suspect acute Ischemic Stroke, initial management, discharge planning and evaluation. The test for feasibility of the CNPG was conducted among twenty one registered nurses working in an emergency department of Sakon Nakhon Hospital. The results revealed that 90.48 percent of nurses reported the CNPG was feasible for implementing into practice. 85.71 percent of nurses identified that was appropriate to implement at Emergency Department. 80.95 percent of nurses identified that was clarity of feedback on practice and the ability to troubleshoot or cause effects on patients. In addition 70.19 percent of nurses identified that this CNPG was easy to use and economical reduce the cost saving in terms of manpower, time, and budget.

Methods: Hp infection status was determined by using Urea Breath Test (UBT). Patients who had previous gastric surgery, Hp eradication treatment or equivocal UBT results were excluded. A questionnaire was administered to elicit information on gender, age, ABO\/Rh blood group type, presence of gastric disease in the family, domestic animal in the household, and treatment for idiopathic Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA). Results: This retrospective study included 500 pediatric patients (179 boys, 321 girls, mean age 10.7±4.3 years) of whom 62 (12.4%) were aged ≤6 years and 438 (87.6%) were aged 7 to 16 years. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) was positive in 245 (49%) cases. In the pre-school age group, 21\/62 cases (34%) had positive UBT while in the school age group 224\/438 children (51%) had positive UBT. A family history of dyspepsia and pet ownership were not associated with Hp positivity. Hp positive 76 (29.8%) children were on IDA treatment but this was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The Hp infection positivity rate was 49% in the pediatric age study group. The positivity rate was significantly lower at preschool age than school age, and it increased with age. There was no association with gender, ABO\/Rh blood groups, presence of domestic pets, IDA, or history of gastric disease in the family.",

One of the primary concerns in Hadoop is how to minimize the completion length (i.e., makespan) of a set of MapReduce jobs. The current Hadoop only allows static slot configuration, i.e., fixed numbers of map slots and reduce slots throughout the lifetime of a cluster. However, we found that such a static configuration may lead to low system resource utilizations as well as long completion length. Motivated by this, we propose simple yet effective schemes which use slot ratio between map and reduce tasks as a tunable knob for reducing the makespan of a given set. By leveraging the workload information of recently completed jobs, our schemes dynamically allocates resources (or slots) to map and reduce tasks. We implemented the presented schemes in Hadoop V0.20.2 and evaluated them with representative MapReduce benchmarks at Amazon EC2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our schemes under both simple workloads and more complex mixed workloads.",

Forest composition ranges from Pinus strobus\/Tsuga\/ hardwoods forests at low elevations through Tsuga\/ hardwoods, hardwoods, and Picea\/Abies forests to Abies-dominated forests at high elevations. Modern pollen percentages for 10 tree taxa were compared with lake elevation using scatter plots and correlation and regression analysis. \n \n \n \nDifferential smoothing of vegetational patterns along the elevational gradient occurred among the 10 taxa owing to differences in pollen dispersibility, pollen production, and spatial pattern of taxon abundance in forests of the region. No differences were observed in pollen-elevation patterns between small and moderate-sized lakes. Pollen-elevation patterns were obscured for most taxa when the gradient was shortened (e.g. to 600–1320 m) owing to increased spatial smoothing by pollen dispersal. Design and interpretation of paleoecological studies of spatial gradients can be improved by careful attention to site spacing, gradient length, and gradient steepness in the context of pollen dispersal and representation models.",

Cell proliferation is of interest since abnormal cell proliferation appears to be a precursor of tumorigenesis and also because the quantitative description of cell proliferation in tumors can be used to predict the biological behavior of a particular neoplasia. 2. There are several reliable methods of studying cell proliferation in tissues. One of the most important is the detection of the Ki67 defined antigen in frozen sections. The number of cells expressing Ki67 correlates with histological grades of tumors and can also be predictive of clinical outcome. The Ki67 can be localized in tissue sections using monoclonal antibodies in association with the immunoperoxidase technique. 3. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a component of DNA polymerase-delta and is another important cell proliferation marker manifesting a striking increase in concentration during the S phase of the cell cycle. 19A2 and PC10 are two different monoclonal antibodies which can be employed to detect PCNA in paraffin-embedded tissues. 4. Molecular biology has also been making a great contribution to the study of cell proliferation. The most recent innovation in tissue identification of proliferating cells is the use of in situ hybridization for the localization of histone H3 and\/or H4 mRNA.

This is truly generous on the part of the editors as my theory aims to supplant one of theirs as the standard bearer for constructivism. Most of the reviewers provide succinct and accurate overviews of key parts of my theory and offer thoughtful criticisms. Welch notes in his introductory essay that his task was not to provide a critique of A Cultural Theory, but he does raise the question: Why is a feminist perspective excluded from my theory? My reply would be that it is not. Women are central to my treatment of honor, and especially the Homeric understanding of honor. In traditional honor societies, women are described as lascivious and seductive and undue interest in them is thought to sap men’s strength and make them unwilling to risk their lives for honor. As Homer became a foundational text of Western culture, and the Homeric understanding of honor and women was central to subsequent Western societies, my analysis lays bare the origins of misogyny and one of the key reasons why it has remained with us over the millennia. Of equal importance, it highlights how reframing the concept of honor – something now underway in Western societies – has the potential to overcome these negative stereotypes and provide a firmer social foundation for gender equality. Nicholas Rengger questions my choice of motives. He agrees that interest, honor, and fear help to explain a lot of foreign policy. But why stop there? There are other important human motives, among them joy, love, and devotion. He answers his own question by acknowledging that these other motives may not be as relevant to international relations. His second concern is the diversity of Greek thought and my failure to represent it adequately. Hesiod, the Old Oligarch, and Protagoras differ with Thucydides, Plato, and Aristotle on key points.

Wolbachia has been shown to stop the growth of a variety of RNA viruses in Drosophila and in mosquitoes. Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti have both reproductive advantages and disadvantages over wild types. If Wolbachia-infected females are fertilized by either normal or infected males, the offspring are healthy and Wolbachia-positive. On the other hand, if Wolbachia-negative females are fertilized by Wolbachia-positive males, the offspring do not hatch. This phenomenon is called cytoplasmic incompatibility. Thus, Wolbachia-positive females have a reproductive advantage, and the Wolbachia is expanded in the population. On the other hand, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes lay fewer eggs and generally have a shorter lifespan. In recent years, scientists have successfully released these Wolbachia-adapted mosquitoes into the wild in several countries and have achieved a high level of replacement with Wolbachia-positive mosquitoes. Here, we propose a minimal mathematical model to investigate the feasibility of such a release method. The model has five steady-states two of which are locally asymptotically stable. One of these stable steady-states has no Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes while for the other steady-state, all mosquitoes are infected with Wolbachia. We apply optimal control theory to find a release method that will drive the mosquito population close to the steady-state with only Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in a two-year time period. Because some of the model parameters cannot be accurately measured or predicted, we also perform uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to quantify how variations in our model parameters affect our results.",

        "abstrak":"Living in space will no longer be a science fiction in the twenty-first century. However, it remains arguable whether space exploration should be promoted for future space colonization. Some advocates claim that it is necessary because space colonization will be the only option for saving humanity. One plausible option for human settlement in space argues that genetic manipulations of the human mind and body might be required in order to dwell in the hostile environments of space. Such manipulations have various ethical issues such as it might harm several generations before the completion of colonization. Can space colonization under such circumstances be justified from ethical points of view? Utilitarianism and deontology can justify such a colonization because they endorse the assumption that saving humanity has the supreme value. In contrast, this paper argues that virtue ethics can reject the assumption. It concludes that, following a virtue-ethical point of view, ending our lives virtuously is more valuable than surviving even though humankind would cease to exist.",

        "abstrak":"The Tevatron Collider at Fermilab is the world's highest energy hadron collider, colliding protons with antiprotons at a center of mass energy of 1800 GeV. At present six proton bunches collide with six antiproton bunches to generate luminosities of up to 9\/spl times\/10\/sup 30\/ cm\/sup -2\/ s\/sup -1\/. It is estimated that to reach luminosities significantly greater than 10\/sup 31\/ cm\/sup -2\/ s\/sup -1\/ while minimizing the number of interactions per crossing, the number of bunches will have to be increased. Thirty-six bunch operation looks like the most promising plan. This paper looks at the strategies for increasing the number of particle bunches, the new hardware that needs to be designed and changes to the operating mode in filling the Tevatron. An interactive program which simulates the filling of the Tevatron collider is also presented. The time scale for multibunch operation and progress towards running greater than six bunches is given in this paper.<<ETX>>",

        "abstrak":"Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) has been introduced for studies of ongoing biological processes but has never been applied for ovarian transplantation. Here, BLI was used as a novel approach to trace the survival of ovarian grafts. The ovarian donors were transgenic mice carrying FVB\/N-Tg (PolII-luc) as a reporter gene, encoding luciferase to catalyse luciferin which results in visible light emission as bioluminescence. There were three groups of recipients: (i) group A: BALB\/c mice without immunosuppressant treatment; (ii) group B: BALB\/c mice receiving a cocktail immunosuppressant treatment; and (iii) group C: immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice without immunosuppression. Luciferin BLI was used to follow graft survival, and viable follicle numbers were counted as a measure of success. Bioluminescence intensity fluctuated but was consistent with the end-point counts of viable follicle numbers. Group A showed loss of viable follicles and bioluminescence disappeared as early as day 10 following ovarian engraftment, indicating strong immune rejection. Groups B and C showed graft survival and measurable bioluminescence for up to 30 days. In conclusion, BLI provided non-invasive longitudinal dynamic monitoring of ovarian grafts with excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution. This approach should prove valuable for research on ovarian transplantation.",

        "abstrak":"Abstract Objective: To evaluate the costs and benefits of the Boston Children's Hospital Community Asthma Initiative (CAI) through reduction of Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for the full pilot-phase program participants. Methods: A cost-benefit analyses was conducted using hospital administrative data to determine an adjusted Return on Investment (ROI): on all 268 patients enrolled in the CAI program during the 33-month pilot program phase of CAI intervention between October 1, 2005 and June 30, 2008 using a comparison group of 818 patients from a similar cohort in neighboring ZIP codes without CAI intervention. Cost data through June 30, 2013 were used to examine cost changes and calculate an adjusted ROI over a 5-year post-intervention period. Results: CAI patients had a cost reduction greater than the comparison group of $1,216 in Year 1 (P = 0.001), $1,320 in Year 2 (P < 0.001), $1,132 (P = 0.002) in Year 3, $1,123 (P = 0.004) in Year 4, and $997 (P = 0.022) in Year 5. Adjusting for the cost savings for the comparison group, the cost savings from the intervention resulted in an adjusted ROI of 1.91 over 5 years. Conclusions: Community-based, multidisciplinary, coordinated disease management programs can decrease the incidence of costly hospitalizations and ED visits from asthma. An ROI of greater than one, as found in this cost analysis, supports the business case for the provision of community-based asthma services as part of patient-centered medical homes and Accountable Care Organizations.",

        "tahun_terbit":2018,
        "abstrak":"Introduction In many type of cancer, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), nerve growth factor (NGF) and its high affinity receptor TRKA are over-expressed and also are involved in proliferation and angiogenesis. On the other hand, many inflammatory molecules such as cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandins (PGE2) are over-expressed in cancer and also involved in the progression of cancer. Besides, a deregulation of some miRs expression has been described in EOC including miR-145 among others. The relationship of NGF-mirRs-COX2 in EOC has not been studied. Then, the aim of this work was to evaluate COX-2 and miR-145 levels in EOC progression and the changes of COX-2 and miR-145 levels by NGF action in epithelial ovarian cancer cell line (A2780). Also we evaluated COX-2 levels by Western-Blot after over-expression of miR-145 in A2780 cell line. Material and methods Thirty human ovarian tissues (normal, tumour and cancer) were obtained from Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department, Clinical Hospital, University of Chile and also from National Institute of Cancer with written consent and authorised by Ethic Committee of the Institutions. The COX-2 levels in tissues and cells were measured by RT-PCR, IHQ, and Western-Blot and miR-145 was measured by qPCR. Cells A2780 were stimulated with NGF (100 and 150 ng\/ml) to measure COX-2 and miR-145 levels. Besides, over-expression of miR-145 was done by transfection assays with lipofectamine-2000 to evaluate cellular invasion and also transduction assays with lenti-virus in order to evaluate COX-2 levels by Western-Blot in A2780 cell line. Results and discussions It was found a significant decrease of miR-145 levels in EOC tissues compared with tumour tissues and normal ovarian tissues (p<0.05). On the other hand, a significant increase of COX-2 levels was found in EOC tissues compared with tumours and normal tissues (p<0.05). The activation of TRKA receptor by NGF induced a significant decrease of miR-145 levels (p<0.05) and a significant increase of COX-2 levels (p<0.05) in epithelial ovarian cancer cell line A2780. When miR-145 was over-expressed in A2780 cells, a significant decrease of COX-2 levels was found (p<0.05). These results support the role of NGF in the regulation of miRs and inflammatory molecules in EOC. Conclusion MicroRNA-145 acts as tumour suppressor microRNA in ovarian cancer and these results suggest that miR-145 could be a good therapy for EOC.

        "tahun_terbit":2017,
        "abstrak":"This thesis studies the navigation task for autonomous UAVs to collect digital data in a risky environment. Three problem formulations are proposed according to different real-world situations. First, we focus on uniform probabilistic risk and assume UAV has unlimited amount of energy. With these assumptions, we provide the graph-based Data-collecting Robot Problem (DRP) model, and propose heuristic planning solutions that consist of a clustering step and a tour building step. Experiments show our methods provide high-quality solutions with high expected reward. Second, we investigate non-uniform probabilistic risk and limited energy capacity of UAV. We present the Data-collection Problem (DCP) to model the task. DCP is a grid-based Markov decision process, and we utilize reinforcement learning with a deep Ensemble Navigation Network (ENN) to tackle the problem. Given four simple navigation algorithms and some additional heuristic information, ENN is able to find improved solutions. Finally, we consider the risk in the form of an opponent and limited energy capacity of UAV, for which we resort to the Data-collection Game (DCG) model. DCG is a grid-based two-player stochastic game where the opponent may have different strategies. We propose opponent modeling to improve data-collection efficiency, design four deep neural networks that model the opponent’s behavior at different levels, and empirically prove that explicit opponent modeling with a dedicated network provides superior performance.

        "judul":"Abstract 3419: Frequency and function of ERBB3 mutations in bladder cancer",
        "tahun_terbit":2014,
        "abstrak":"Deregulation of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases has been widely implicated in cancer initiation and progression. Activating mutations or gene amplification of EGFR and ERBB2 (HER2) are frequently found in non-small cell lung, breast, colorectal, glioblastoma and head and neck cancers. However, little is known regarding the prevalence or functionality of genomic alterations in the ERBB3 (HER3) isoform. Although ERBB3 has limited inherent kinase activity, ligand stimulation promotes its dimerization with active kinases like ERBB2 and EGFR that can phosphorylate ERBB3 which then promotes transformation. Thus genomic alterations in ERBB3 may be a key means of promoting oncogenic signaling despite the protein lacking robust enzymatic activity. We performed a meta-analysis of 40 cross-cancer next generation sequencing and copy number genomics data sets newly generated by our group (bladder) or found in recently published repositories (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Broad, Genentech, Sanger, etc). Analogous to the singular 2013 publication on ERBB3 mutations to date, we found frequent mutations in ERBB3 in gastric tumors (∼11%). Preliminary analysis of our novel and expanding cohort of 109 high-grade bladder cancer tumors suggests that ERBB3 mutations are equally frequent in bladder cancer (∼10-12%). Collectively, EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB3 alterations were found in 23-30% of all high-grade bladder cancers, typically in a mutually exclusive pattern suggesting that these may be driver events. ERBB3 mutations were distributed across all structural domains of the protein. We identified more than 15 novel ERBB3 mutations in our bladder cohort, including hotspot mutations in the extracellular domain (V104L\/M, D297Y, others) that were recurrent across multiple cancers types. Stable retroviral overexpression of ERBB3 mutants into NIH-3T3 cells induced phosphorylation of ERBB3, activation of downstream signaling cascades and soft agar colony formation, all which were enhanced in the presence of neuregulin and inhibited by the dual EGFR\/ERBB2 kinase inhibitor, neratinib, and a monoclonal antibody to ERBB3, AMG-888\/U3-1287. These data highlight a large cohort of bladder cancer patients with novel, activating mutations in the tractable kinase ERBB3, that could potentially benefit from approved EGFR\/ERBB2 targeted therapeutics in the clinic and novel ERBB3 therapeutics in early clinical trials.

Maxillofacial surgeons and dentists make wide use of cephalometric analysis in diagnosis, surgery and treatment planning. Accuracy and repeatability of the manual approach, the most common approach in clinical practice, are limited by intra- and inter-subject variability in landmark identification. So, we propose a computer-aided landmark annotation approach that estimates the three-dimensional (3D) positions of 21 selected landmarks.MethodsThe procedure involves an adaptive cluster-based segmentation of bone tissues followed by an intensity-based registration of an annotated reference volume onto a patient Cone Beam CT (CBCT) head volume. The outcomes of the annotation process are presented to the clinician as a 3D surface of the patient skull with the estimate landmark displayed on it. Moreover, each landmark is centered into a spherical confidence region that can help the clinician in a subsequent manual refinement of the annotation. The algorithm was validated onto 18 CBCT images.ResultsAutomatic segmentation shows a high accuracy level with no significant difference between automatically and manually determined threshold values. The overall median value of the localization error was equal to 1.99 mm with an interquartile range (IQR) of 1.22–2.89 mm.ConclusionThe obtained results are promising, segmentation was proved to be very robust and the achieved accuracy level in landmark annotation was acceptable for most of landmarks and comparable with other available methods.",

Firstly, the operating modes of MT are introduced briefly. Then operating characters and influence on traditional system protection are analyzed while MTs are connecting to the grid. The different dual mode schemes are compared via simulating different 10 kV line fault cases. Simulation results indicated that type II MT connected with grid via synchronal generator supplied larger short-circuit current, as well as worse influence on superior protection and equipment-selecting than those of type I MT which is connected with grid by converter. Further more, although type II MT can realize seamless transition, type II MT needs more strict mode transform condition than type I does, such as needing to coordinate the protection settings of turbine and system, and a braking resistance box should be used when MT is changing operating mode from grid connected (GC) mode to stand alone (SA) mode. While being grid-connected, type II MT is prone to be effected by other 10 kV lines fault. Contrarily, although type I turbine can not transform seamlessly, it has little influence on superior system protection and switchgear-selecting, as well as supplying low short circuit current.",

Even if they are an interesting and promising idea, recent statistics detected poor usage and a relatively short lifetime. In this approach, a conversational system is designed which is not simply reactive to a user's request, but capable of engaging in a collaboration with its users, by taking over the initiative in problematic and unclear situations. By comparing conversational interfaces to finite state machines a formal definition of proactivity is reached and a standard implementation methodology is suggested.

        "abstrak":"Abstract Optimizing the combined horizontal and vertical accuracy of the well-known Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEMs) of various resolutions for each country and region especially in Iraq's mountainous areas is still questionable. All the three GDEMs, approximately, have the same vertical accuracy with the Root Mean Square (RMSE) of ±7.3 m, ±7.6 m and ±6.5 m via 12 fixed Ground Control Points (GCPs) for the Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR 12.5 m), the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM 30 m) and the TerraSAR-X (the name of twin satellites) add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X 90 m) GDEMs respectively. Moreover, the percentage of outliers that are greater or smaller than ±10 m detection of the height extraction from both the ALOS PALSAR and SRTM Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) contains 16.7% and for TanDEM-X was 25%. In this paper, the special DEM is derived using 2123 handheld GPS points for Sulaymaniyah Governorate, Kurdistan region, Iraq. The height extraction by discarding the outliers of 58% gives the RMSE of ±8.0 m in the case of adding geoid heights (N) to the ellipsoidal heights (h) via the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008) and ±5.6 m without adding N. It is expected that the derived DEMs will give more accurate results both horizontally and vertically in the mountainous areas when GPS observations are intensified. The horizontal accuracy is validated through extracting hierarchy stream types of the watershed map from the DEMs for higher than 100 pixels length. The ALOS PALSAR DEM extracted more numbers of stream orders than others. Finally, based on the criteria of RMSE, outlier detection, and the number of extracted stream orders, the ALOS PALSER DEM is regarded as the optimal GDEM in comparison with the close accuracy of both the TanDEM-X and SRTM DEM.",

To overcome this drawback, the use of conventional affordable instruments for SILS was encouraged. We present our case series of SILS with conventional instruments in a tertiary care centre. Methods: This is a single centre pilot study of 30 consecutive cases operated by SILS using conventional laparoscopic instruments. Outcomes measured were operative time, post-operative pain by Visual analogue scale (VAS), resumption of oral diet, duration of stay in the hospital, wound cosmesis and complications. Results: Thirty patients (21 females and nine males; mean age 35.05 ± 12.06 years) were operated by SILS procedure. Twenty single incision laparoscopic Cholecystectomies(SILC), seven single incision laparoscopic appendectomies (SILA) and three single incision diagnostic laparoscopies(SIDL) were done with average operative time of 92 minutes, 47 minutes and 53 minutes respectively. All surgeries were performed successfully without conversion to conventional laparoscopy or open method. Majority patients were given oral feeds and discharged on the second postoperative day without any complications. Wound cosmesis was satisfactory with an inconspicuous scar in all patients. Conclusion: Our initial experience of using conventional laparoscopic instruments for SILS demonstrates its feasibility and utility especially in resource challenged settings. The advantage of SILS is its reduced need of analgesics and better wound cosmesis, without significant post-operative complications.",

        "abstrak":"Summary \nIsolations of Mycocaha denudata and M. duriaeana were grown in plate culture and their mating systems studied. The former species is heteromictic and shows both bipolar diaphoromixis and facultative homo-heteromixis, the latter species is almost certainly homomictic. None of these mating systems have been found before in Nidulariales. It is suggested that the abundance, morphological variation and ecological tolerance of these species may be related to their kinds of mating system. Facultative homo-heteromixis in M. denudata results in spores being produced in a single peridiolum which are either homocaryotic or heterocaryotic in respect of mating-type factors. The condition is due to a dominant gene Pd which determines a precocious division of the four nuclei, formed by a normal meiosis, in each basidium. The eight nuclei so formed appear to migrate at random, in respect of the mating-type factors they carry, into the basidiospores which are each ultimately binucleate. This mechanism is not yet known in other Basidiomycetes. \n \nIsolations of M. denudata fell into two groups (I and II) between which there was complete sterility but no other constant distinguishing features could be observed between them. The occurrence of such groups is thought to be of significance in fungi and at present it seems best to regard them as comparable to sibling species. Four mating-type factors were identified amongst the six isolations of group I, seven amongst the sixteen isolations of group II. Estimates of the total numbers of mating-type factors in group I and group II are seven to eight and twelve to thirteen respectively. Thus, like other Nidulariales, M. denudata appears to have only a relatively small number of mating-type factors and the relation of this to inbreeding and dispersal mechanisms is discussed.",

Radiotherapy generates a variety of lipids that bind to the receptor for platelet-activating factor, expressed by cells in the tumor microenvironment. In the present study, using the TC-1 tumor cell line, we found that irradiation induced a twofold increase in receptor expression and generated agonists of receptor. Irradiated cells induced a 20-fold increase in live TC-1 proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, subcutaneous co-injection of irradiated TC-1 cells with TC-1 expressing luciferase (TC-1 fluc+) markedly increased TC-1 fluc+ proliferation in a receptor-dependent way. Moreover we used a human carcinoma cell line not expressing the PAF receptor (KBM) and the same cell transfected with the receptor gene (KBP). Following co-injection of live KBP cells with irradiated KBM in RAG mice, the tumor growth was significantly increased compared with tumor formed following co-injection of live KBM with irradiated KBM. This tumor cell repopulation correlated with increased infiltration of tumor-promoting macrophages (CD206+).

Southern Ukraine suffers from severe droughts, floods and soil salinisation already today. It is therefore of utmost importance to use the available water resources optimally to provide food security for the regions and to avoid loads of coastal waters. The paper reports the results of studies that were carried out on three Crimean pilot areas. These pilots comprise the whole catchments of the rivers Salgir and Pobednaya because the quite various land-uses contribute to the river water discharge in different ways. The main problems of the upper Salgir sub-basin are related to erosion and urbanisation impacts. The transfer zone and coastal areas are subject to intensive restructuring and agricultural developments, including the reconstruction and reorganisation of irrigation systems. The river Pobednaya drains a coastal area in the North-East of Crimea. Here, irrigation and drainage and additionally waste water discharges have impacts on the Sivash wetlands that increasingly cover the coastal area of the Sea of Azov. In order to solve all these problems, regional stakeholders have been invited to develop scenarios that are further evaluated by modelling exercises. Model results show the consequences of those scenarios and thus support finding the best solution.",

This article develops this potentially revolutionary principle of positive obligations, which amazingly remains unsung and unused more than a quarter of a century after it became an integral part of Nigerian law. The first part of the article proposes the principle as the most effective basis to compel the enactment of a Freedom of Information legislation, which successive governments have refused to enact despite overwhelming public support and sustained lobbying for a Freedom of Information Bill first introduced in the National Assembly in 1997. The second part critically analyses the latest (2007) version of the Bill. It concludes that its provisions are inadequate to give effect to the right to freedom of information in view of the legal and bureaucratic environment under which it will operate, and suggests remedial measures.",

According to the potential energy surface only the properties for the most stable conformer of each member of the series and their anions were analyzed in function of electronegativity and atomic radius of X. The results show that when X=H, the salt and its anion have symmetry CS while the symmetry change to C1 for the halogenated F, Cl, and Br derivatives and their anions. Both, electronegativity and atomic radius properties show higher effects on V than on μ. Similar behaviors are observed when the Mulliken charges on N and X atoms are analyzed vs electronegativites, and atomic radius of X while an important decreasing on NPA charges of X is observed when increase its electronegativity. The strong influence of electronegativity and atomic radius of X are evidenced in the low bond order value observed in the C1 atom of F salt. The strong energetic π*C2-C3 → π*C4-C5 transition observed only for the F salt confer to it a high stability. The frontier orbitals have revealed that the 6-H-IFTB salt is the less reactive species while the higher reactivity is predicted for the Br salt. Evidently, the smaller electronegativity and higher atomic radius of Br justify the high reactivity predicted for its salt.

With the help of a UAV overhead, troops on the ground can get instantaneous situational awareness of the threats behind nearby hills or buildings. Despite the significant successes of unmanned systems on the battlefield, several issues exist which must be addressed before UAVs can truly integrate into joint and combined operations. The major issues are airspace congestion, frequency\/bandwidth saturation, and limited interoperability of UAV systems. This paper will briefly outline the history of UAVs and the anticipated future growth of these systems in militaries around the world, especially in the United States. The main focus will be on detailing the three identified issues with UAVs, and explain why continuing to address each issue with a disjointed, service-specific approach will limit UAV employment in current and future combat zones.",

Despite their advantages, variable stiffness resettable devices are under-utilized mainly because of the shortage of fundamental research in quantifying the sensitivity of key seismic response parameters, and losses, in structures that use such systems for seismic hazard mitigation. Within this setting, the research summarized herein measures the effectiveness of semi-active resettable energy dissipating devices in the Single-Degree-of-Freedom domain aiming at quantifying the sensitivity of their seismic response to variation in control parameters and generating the required knowledge to utilize such semi-active devices in the Multi-Degree-of-Freedom domain. The performance (i.e. maximum relative displacement and peak absolute acceleration demands) of Single-Degree-of-Freedom systems with an array of semi-active control logics under various dynamic excitation regimes is studied. Two sets of 40 ground motions representing various seismic loading conditions (i.e. pulse-like and rock-site ground motions) are used, and an efficient control logic for mitigating these seismic demands is proposed. Numerical results show that proposed control logic enables a decrease of 40–60% for both maximum relative displacement and seismic base shear and 15–25% decrease for peak absolute acceleration.

An adaptive measurement termination method is proposed to terminate the online imaging when the quality of the recovered image is satisfied. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by numerical simulations and experiments and its imaging performance is assessed by comparing the results with state-of-the-art FWHTGI (fast Walsh-Hadamard transform CGI) and RDCGI (Russian dolls ordering CGI). The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve high-quality imaging with few measurements, and imaging quality is better than that with FWHTGI and RDCGI under low measurement number conditions. The proposed scheme may be helpful for high-resolution and real-time CGI.",

        "abstrak":"Introduction: Why are some patterns common cross-linguistically, while others are rare or unattested? Most work assessing the typological predictions of phonological grammars have focused on the binary distinction between attested vs. unattested, and do not account for the relative frequency of attested patterns. Anttila (1997) and Bane and Riggle (2008) hypothesize that the relative frequency of a pattern is proportional to the number of constraint rankings that generate it. This is an intuitive hypothesis, but as a model of typological frequency, it assumes that the set of languages has been generated randomly, and transmitted perfectly. However, Staubs (2014), Stanton (2016), and others observe that some rankings are difficult to acquire, because the evidence that distinguishes them from other rankings is rare in the input to learners. Thus, patterns corresponding to these rankings may be mislearned, becoming rare or even unattested over time. Staubs and Stanton show that certain unattested stress patterns are indeed likely to be reanalyzed as other, attested patterns, given “ordinary” data. In this paper, we examine the broader predictions of this approach for relative typological frequency. We test whether a learning model, iterated over many generations, gradually approximates the attested frequencies of stress patterns in StressTyp2 (Goedemans, Heinz, and van der Hulst 2014).",

Background:Prophylactic CND and LND are not routinely employed. Adjuvant radioiodine treatment may be modulated, however, by surgical staging of the neck. Methods:Retrospective study, consecutive patients ultrasonographically classified cN0 treated with prophylactic CND, and lateral LND (levels III and IV). The number of nodes was resected and the incidence of pN1 was recorded. Results:For 317 patients (254 women, mean age 44 years, mean tumor size 17 mm), the number of lymph nodes was 5 for unilateral CND, 9 for bilateral CND, and 12 for LND. pN1 stage was 42% overall: 23% for unilateral CND, 39% for bilateral CND, and 23% for LND (median number of metastatic nodes = 2 for each). Fifty-five percent of the patients staged pN1 had metastatic nodes in the lateral neck. Ten percent had more than 10 metastatic nodes and\/or more than 3 nodes with extra capsular spread. pN1 was correlated with tumor size (P = 0.0025), extrathyroidal tumor extension (P < 0.0001), male sex (P = 0.0006), and age younger than 45 years (P = 0.0003). Permanent hypoparathyroidism and unintentional recurrent nerve paralysis occurred in 2 cases each. Patients staged pN0 received less radioiodine than patients staged pN1 (median 30 vs 100 mCi, P < 0.0001). Conclusions:For staging, bilateral prophylactic CND is preferable to unilateral CND. Prophylactic CND with LND optimizes staging providing a basis for a personalized approach for adjuvant radioiodine.",

        "abstrak":"This paper investigates the implications of capital service uncertainty and industry risk pooling on the behavior of a competitive firm and the allocation of resources in a two-sector, general equilibrium framework. The issue of input supply uncertainty has been previously considered by Carlton [3], Gould [5] and DeVany and Saving [4] in long run market equilibrium models, and by Turnovsky [11] and Martin [7] in short-run disequilibrium models. Turnovsky argues that the firm responding to input supply uncertainty increases its orders for the random inputs and the firm produces the same level of output with the same factor mix as it would under certainty. Martin finds that the effect of uncertainty in the supply of one input on the optimal choice of the other input depends upon the technology of production. Specifically the effect of the uncertainty is qualitatively the same as the effect of an increase in the price of the input under certainty. That is, the uncertainty is analogous to an implicit price associated with the use of that input. If markets for risk sharing exist, some uncertainty problems can be analyzed with deterministic models. For example, variations in the weather make agricultural production random. If mandatory and complete external crop insurance exists, the representative farmer chooses inputs and the optimal number of acres to cultivate under certainty. From the farmer's perspective, both individually and collectively, the risk has been shifted to the second party insurance carriers. If, on the other hand, farmers provide collective self-insurance (they share or pool the risk within the industry), the problem is transformed from a random production problem to a random insurance premium per acre problem. In a world with no transaction costs and actuarially neutral insurance, total premium payments must equal the market value of all production losses over the repeated trials implied by long run stationary state equilibrium. If capital is subject to failure, production losses will occur. Industry wide self-insurance implies that random capital service can be modeled as random insurance premiums per unit of capital employed. Two sets of results are derived in this paper. The first set involves the impact of random capital service on the firm's behavior. It is shown that capital service uncertainty leads to a reduction in the firm's output, inputs, and capital labor ratio. A reduction in capital reliability or a marginal increase in uncertainty have similar effects. The second set of results involves sectoral resource",

        "abstrak":"The purpose of this study was to identify the meaning of traditional ethics associated with filial duty and manners, found in Myeangsim Bogam the classical book on Humanistic Education rooted in Confucian ideology of Orientalism, through the prism of contemporary Humanistic Education targeting adolescents. The result of this study showed that filial duty and manners ideology found in Myeangsim Bogam placed a greater emphasis on putting both filial duty and manners into practice, rather than achievement of fame and prestige. Particularly, Hyogyeong and Analects of Confucius extolled filial duty as the source of all virtues and manners as paragon of one-hundred types of behavior. In this context, the best way to achieve objectives of Humanistic Education -- which aims to promote restoration of morality in contemporary society should be the movement of acting out and value there of that could be found in Myeangsim Bogam. Thus, this study looked into the tasks for inheritance and development of traditional filial duty and manners ideology as Humanistic Education as below. First, Humanistic Education should be provided in conjunction with home education. Humanistic Education should start from home to ensure undisrupted and smooth implementation of Humanistic Education, considering that family is a group that creates and maintains common culture through communication. Second, school education needs to provide continued and in-depth knowledge and insight on filial duty and manners ideology. school education is too inadequate to provide a link to the disconnected tradition of education on filial duty and manners ideology. Thus, The school should expand contents which are related to filial duty and manners and practically promote filial duty and manners movement. Third, social education should underpin and follow the Humanistic Education. That is driven by the fact that social education actually has more significant educational effect in the field of Humanistic Education due to the influence of mass media characterized by action-oriented way of perception. Such pursuit can be made through a method that integrates the 3 types of education such as home, school, and social education, etc. After all, filial duty and manners as Humanistic Education rooted in universal love to achieve healthy and sound society and human community, as well as right family relationship, and for that, preceding studies would need to be carried out.",

        "abstrak":"The classical model of mast cell secretory granule formation suggests that newly synthesized secretory mediators, transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex, undergo post-transitional modification and are packaged for secretion by condensation within membrane-bound granules of unit size. These unit granules may fuse with other granules to form larger granules that reside in the cytoplasm until secreted. A novel stochastic model for mast cell granule growth and elimination (G&E) as well as inventory management is presented. Resorting to a statistical mechanics approach in which SNAP (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein) REceptor (SNARE) components are viewed as interacting particles, the G&E model provides a simple 'nano-machine' of SNARE self-aggregation that can perform granule growth and secretion. Granule stock is maintained as a buffer to meet uncertainty in demand by the extracellular environment and to serve as source of supply during the lead time to produce granules of adaptive content. Experimental work, mathematical calculations, statistical modeling and a rationale for the emergence of nearly last-in, first out inventory management, are discussed.",

        "abstrak":"Landsat MSS and ETM+ images were analyzed to detect 25-year land-cover change (1976–2001) in the critical Taguibo Watershed in Mindanao Island, Southern Philippines. This watershed has experienced historical modifications of its land-cover due to the presence of logging industries in the 1950s, and continuous deforestation due to illegal logging and slash-and-burn agriculture in the present time. To estimate the impacts of land-cover change on watershed runoff, land-cover information derived from the Landsat images was utilized to parameterize a GIS-based hydrologic model. The model was then calibrated with field-measured discharge data and used to simulate the responses of the watershed in its year 2001 and year 1976 land-cover conditions. The availability of land-cover information on the most recent state of the watershed from the Landsat ETM+ image made it possible to locate areas for rehabilitation such as barren and logged-over areas. We then created a “rehabilitated” land-cover condition map of the watershed (re-forestation of logged-over areas and agro-forestation of barren areas) and used it to parameterize the model and predict the runoff responses of the watershed. Model results showed that changes in land-cover from 1976 to 2001 were directly related to the significant increase in surface runoff. Runoff predictions showed that a full rehabilitation of the watershed, especially in barren and logged-over areas, will be likely to reduce the generation of a huge volume of runoff during rainfall events. The results of this study have demonstrated the usefulness of multi-temporal Landsat images in detecting land-cover change, in identifying areas for rehabilitation, and in evaluating rehabilitation strategies for management of tropical watersheds through its use in hydrologic modeling.",

The ability of an organism to survive and grow in cryoenviroments depends on a number of adaptive strategies aimed at maintaining vital cellular functions at subzero temperatures, which include the structural modifications of the membrane. To understand the role of the membrane in the adaptation, it is necessary to characterize the cell-wall components, such as the lipopolysaccharides, that represent the major constituent of the outer membrane. The aim of this study was to investigate the structure of the carbohydrate backbone of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) isolated from the cold-adapted Psychrobacter arcticus 273-4. The strain, isolated from a 20,000-to-30,000-year-old continuously frozen permafrost in Siberia, was cultivated at 4 °C. The LOS was isolated from dry cells and analyzed by means of chemical methods. In particular, it was degraded either by mild acid hydrolysis or by hydrazinolysis and investigated in detail by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and by ESI FT-ICR mass spectrometry. The oligosaccharide was characterized by the substitution of the heptose residue, usually linked to Kdo in the inner core, with a glucose, and for the unusual presence of N-acetylmuramic acid.",

It is found that the generalized gradient approximation gives a much better reflection of the ground state properties than local density approximation, and that a very strong covalent bonding is formed in A-La 2 O 3 , mainly due to the pronounced hybridization between O 2p and La 5d as well as 5p states. Calculations also reveal that the electronic contribution to heat capacity of fcc La should be bigger than that of dhcp La, and that elastic anisotropy of A-La 2 O 3 would cause the big difference of thermal expansion along the a and c axes. Moreover, the elastic properties of La and A-La 2 O 3 decease almost linearly with the increase of temperature, and the descending sequence of bulk moduli is E → B → G within the entire temperature range. The strong covalent bonding of A-La 2 O 3 would be enhanced (reduced) with the decrease (increase) of temperature, and the calculated results are in good agreement with experimental observations in the literature.",

Interestingly, the mesh was also found to be 70% occluded by sodium chloride crystals which almost certainly explains the resistance change. It is noteworthy that the third mesh which was not removed as a result of resistance changes, but at a routine service change, did bear fibrous material but the pressure difference across the mesh was normal. It was suggested to us that the groups’ observations were related to the use of the filter as a heat and moisture exchanging filter (HMEF) since no problems were experienced when the filter was placed on the ventilator expiratory port. The authors proposed that perhaps the HMEF was stressed and shed fibres. We have subjected the filter to extensive tests in the course of research and development and continue to monitor filter integrity with 100% inmanufacture testing, but we set up a further experiment under the supervision of the Bristol group in our laboratories. No fibres were detected on a transducer mesh placed in the expiratory line after a period of 12 days with a filter change in excess of normal recommended use times (to increase the severity of the test). We have also visited the unit in which these observations were made, and have found that the normal practices of the unit for ventilated patients make it very difficult to pinpoint the potential exposure of the transducer mesh to a single manufacturer’s filter. Two types of breathing systems are used in conjunction with the Servo 900B and 900C ventilators. Type A has inspiratory tubing, expiratory tubing, Ypiece, Pall HMEF, catheter mount (and since the observation of transducer contaminants an additional Pall filter has been placed on the expiratory port). Type B has inspiratory tubing plus water trap, water bath humidifier with blotting paper insert (cellulose), Ypiece, catheter mount, expiratory tubing plus water trap, heated expiratory filter (Cape Microflow). A type A system is often replaced with a type B system and, as such, a single transducer mesh is exposed to both types of filter. Analysis suggests that the substrate of the media fragments from the Cape filter give similar readings to Pall media, except that hydrophobic resins are not present. We agree with Dr Taylor and his colleagues that it is impossible to be certain that the debris collected on the transducer originated from the circuit filter. Other publications have indicated the filter to be a safe device for contamination control and effective humidification when used as an HMEF.1,2 We are engaged in work to identify the sources of the fibrous materials. These may include, for example, nebuliser drive line filters, tubing, inspiratory gases, inspiratory filter (built into ventilator), expiratory filters or HMEFs (Cape and Pall), the atmosphere (contamination by glass fibres and cellulose), humidifier (paper) and perhaps others. We believe however that the incident which resulted in transducer occlusion was due to blockage by saline crystals and was unrelated to the use of the filter. However, we are not confident of our ability to identify a single source of what appears to be contamination from multiple origins.",

The results summarized in this study are as follows. a) One percent resinous materials was extracted, after the soaking of the veneers in 30 percent diluted methanol. b) No marks of the dirty stains of resinous materials on the face of the treated plywood was shown, although many quite dirty stains on the face of untreated plywood have contrary seen. c) However, the strip shear test strength of the treated plywood was not decreased. It means that there is no difference in the strength between the treated plywood and the untreated plywood. The strength values were 25.08 kg\/ and 24.98 kg\/, respectively. d) The strip shear test strength of plywood made of the treated veneers in 2 percent malenit solution was not decreased. e) The slight decrease of the strip shear test strength of the treated plywood made of the treated veneer in 40 percent ammonuim phosphate solution was shown. However, the remarkable difference of the fire retardation activities between the treated specimens and the untreated specimens has seen as in Table 10, that is, the fire proofed specimens had taken about 28 seconds to start to burn, while the untreated specimens had taken 15 seconds to reach to burning.

Objective: To identify and compare the distribution of MMP-2 and BSP in healthy human coronal dentin and those with early caries. Methods: Freshly extracted 3rd molars and premolars with and without early caries were fixed, demineralized and subjected to immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal anti-MMP-2 antibody and monoclonal anti-BSP antibody with an avidin-biotin complex method. Immunoreactivity was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate and observed under light microscopy. Results: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that MMP-2 and BSP are not detected in the tubule lumens of healthy dentin. However, intense immunoreactivity for MMP-2 and BSP was detected in association with the full length of the caries-affected dentinal tubules. The MMP-2 and BSP at the dentino-enamel junction appeared unaltered. Conclusion: The results indicate that MMP-2 and BSP may be actively secreted by odontoblasts in response to carious insult. MMP-2 and BSP accumulation in the caries-affected dentinal tubules may indicate their potential involvement in the host defense mechanism which results in calcification of regions affected by the carious process.",

Friction experiments were conducted in vacuum (10 sub -10 mm Hg) with a hemispherical rider specimen of the copper-gold alloy sliding on itself or 440-C stainless steel. The specimens were examined under loads of 1000 grams, sliding speeds to 880 centimeters per second, and temperatures to 400 C. The results of these studies indicate lower coefficients of friction for the alloys Cu3Au and CuAu in the atomically ordered state than for these alloys in a disordered state. The 10-atomic-percent- gold alloy, which does not become ordered, did not reflect any marked changes in friction when examined under conditions similar to those for Cu3Au and CuAu.",

Given a set O of points, a query point q, and a ρ-radius circle C, the NNH query returns the nearest placement of C to q such that there are at least k points enclosed by C. We present a fast algorithm for processing the NNH query based on the incremental retrieval of nearest neighbors using the R-tree structure on O. Our solution includes several techniques, to efficiently maintain sets of retrieved nearest points and identify their validities in terms of the closeness constraint of their points. These techniques are devised from the unique characteristics of the NNH search problem. As a side product, we solve a new geometric problem, called the nearest enclosing circle (NEC) problem, which is of independent interest. We present a linear expected-time algorithm solving the NEC problem using the properties of the NEC similar to those of the smallest enclosing circle. We provide extensive experimental results, which show that our techniques can significantly improve the query performance.",

        "tahun_terbit":2014,
        "abstrak":"Historically, women have been victims to a much greater degree than perpetrators of violence. However, the 1970s witnessed the emergence of women as important protagonists in the conflicts across the world. Recent years have witnessed suicide attacks perpetrated by women suicide bombers. This growing trend of women bombers has the general public and counterterrorism specialists concerned because of its implication that women will be key players in future terrorist attacks. Women’s role in terrorist organisations have also transformed since 1970s.Women across the ideological spectrum played different roles at different times. The use of women for “soft tasks” like logistics and recruitment gradually started to change in the mid-1980s when they started playing a much more visible frontline role. A woman taking up a suicide bombing role diverges significantly and is far more dangerous than their traditional activity of playing logisticians, recruiters or even a frontline role. This paper scrutinizes this change. There are multi causal issues which drive women to join terrorism and more so as suicide bombers. Psychological, economic, political, religious and sociological factors can act as contributors to understanding the causes that drive women towards terrorism. This paper attempts to highlight the role played by women in various terrorist organisations around the world. It also tries to bring out the factors which influence women to participate in terrorist acts. It aims to bring out the above facts by analysing various groups which have women cadre. Previous studies in the same realm have focused on a particular group or a conflict whereas this paper attempts to examine female participation across multiple conflicts in different groups driven by different ideology, which provides a clear insight into the multi causal factors which are responsible for this trend. The methodology followed is a descriptive one wherein the analysis is conducted on information derived from published secondary data.",

ALD diagnosed by excluding other liver diseases (except HCV) and alcohol abuse of > 40 g\/d in women and > 60 g\/d in men for > 5 years. NAFLD diagnosed by excluding other liver diseases and a history of alcohol use of < 10 g\/d. Cirrhosis was diagnosed using biopsy for uncertain clinical diagnosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to patients with NAFLD (n = 365; mean age 50 yrs; 43% males; 53% diabetic), ALD patients (n = 206; mean age 51 yrs; 68% males; 24% diabetic) presented more often with cirrhosis or complications(46vs. 12%; P< 0.0001) with a higher MELD score (13 ± 7 vs. 8 ± 8; P<0.0001). On logistic regression, ALD diagnosis was associated with presence of cirrhosis by over 4-fold (4.1 [1.8-9.1]) even after excluding 23 patients with concomitant HCV. Over median follow up of about 3 and 4 yrs among ALD and NAFLD patients respectively, ALD patients more frequently developed cirrhosis or its complications including HCC with worse transplant free survival (90 vs. 95%; P = 0.038).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCompared to NAFLD, ALD patients present at an advanced stage of liver disease with a faster progression on follow-up.

One concept for accomplishing this is a reflux boiler device which operates like a heat pipe, transferring waste heat from the habitat module via a thermal bus to vertical tubes radiating to space. A previous paper by these authors describes a mathematical model of several lightweight tube configurations which had been built and tested by various manufacturers. Following model verification through correlation with NASA vacuum chamber test data, the model was used to simulate both single tubes and a linear array of tubes for lunar surface operation. After comparing the heat rejection capability of three pf the manufactured tubes under similar conditions with normalized tube dimensions, performance predictions for a linear array of tubes operating in the lunar surface environment were then developed. The subject of this paper is an extension of the simulation effort for one of these tube types, which includes the optimization of a linear array of composite tubes for operation in a worst-case lunar surface thermal environment.",

Bactenal production in surface waters was maximal at intermediate salinities (15 to 30 %o). Nutrlent enrichment experiments suggested that bacterial growth near the outflow of the river was C limited whereas bacteria in plume waters of intermediate salinities were P and N limited. Rates of plankton community oxygen demand measured during winter were also maximal at intermediate salinities indicating an area of increased heterotrophic activity. The oxygen demand associated with heterotrophic bacterioplankton activity during summer was an important factor leading to hypoxic conditions in bottom waters of the Louisiana continental shelf. In summer, bacterial abundance and production ranged from 0.25 to 3.34 X log cells 1.' and from 4 to 90 pg C 1-' d-l, respectively. In winter, the corresponding ranges were 0.36 to 1.09 X log cells I-' and 3 to 20 pg C 1-' d-' Depth-integrated bacterial production on the Louisiana shelf decreased from 443 k 144 mg C m-2 d' in summer to 226 f 124 mg C m-2 d-' in winter. Using empirically-derived bacterial growth efficiency values of 19 and 29 %, we estimated that bacterial production in summer could be supported by 10 to 58 % of phytoplankton production. In winter, the amount of carbon needed to support bacterial production exceeded phytoplankton production suggesting that bacterial growth during this season was heavily dependent on riverine sources of organic matter.",

A detailed inventory of energy and exergy losses of the different process sections is presented and potential process improvements due to a better utility choice or feed pretreatment like drying or pyrolysis are discussed. While Viking gasification performs better as an isolated gas generator than state-of-the-art FICFB gasification, there is large potential for improvement of the FICFB system.

Little is known regarding the impact of PVNS on total hip arthroplasty (THA). Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine if patients with PVNS of the hip undergoing primary THA experience greater (1) in-hospital lengths of stay (LOS); (2) complications; (3) readmission rates; and (4) costs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients undergoing primary THA for PVNS of the hip from the years 2005 to 2014 were identified using a nationwide claims registry. PVNS patients were matched to a control cohort in a 1:5 ratio by age, gender, and various comorbidities. The query yielded 7440 patients with (n = 1240) and without (n = 6200) PVNS of the hip undergoing primary THA. Endpoints analyzed included LOS, complications, readmission rates, and costs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios (OR) of developing complications. Welch's t-tests were used to test for significance in LOS and cost between the cohorts. A P-value less than .001 was considered statistically significant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPVNS patients had approximately 8% longer in-hospital LOS (3.8 vs 3.5 days, P = .0006). PVNS patients had greater odds of (OR 1.60, P < .0001) medical and (OR 1.81, P < .0001) implant-related complications. Furthermore, PVNS patients were found to have higher odds (OR 1.84, P < .0001) of 90-day readmissions. PVNS patients also incurred higher day of surgery ($13,119 vs $11,983, P < .0001) and 90-day costs ($17,169 vs $15,097, P < .0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWithout controlling for global trends in LOS, complications, readmissions, or costs between 2005 and 2014, the findings of the study suggest that PVNS of the hip is associated with worse outcomes and higher costs following primary THA. The study is useful as orthopedic surgeons can use the study to educate patients of the complications which may occur following their hip surgery.",

Methods Twenty-five patients with SCA, 16 males and 9 females, aged 18～92, received advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) within 3 minutes after the onset, and underwent continuous measurement of PetCO2 since the beginning of ACLS. The values of PetCO2 at different time points of CPR were compared between the patients who succeeded to obtain return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and those who failed.Results Nine patients succeeded to obtain RPSC and 16 failed. The values of PetCO2 at the beginning of ACLS were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P0.05), and the values 5, 10, and 20 min later of the ROSC group increased gradually and were all significantly higher than those of the failure group (all P=0.00). The PetCO2 20 minutes later of the ROSC group was 10 mmHg in all the 9 patients, with the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values all of 100%. Conclusion PetCO2 is positively correlated with the outcome of SCA patients receiving CPR. The PetCO2 ≤10 mmHg 20 min after the beginning of ACLS predicts the failure of CPR and means that CPR can be terminated then.",

Control is usually based on the use of chemical anthelmintics (dewormers); but these are prohibited from use in organic livestock, and the effectiveness of chemical anthelmintics in conventional operations is limited by high levels of anthelmintic resistance. Consequently, herbal dewormers are increasing in popularity as an alternative to chemical dewormers for GIN control. However, the effectiveness of herbal dewormers remains unproven. The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a commercially available herbal dewormer to control GIN in goats. Lactating (n=16) and young (n=8) dairy goats grazed poor quality mixed grass pastures between March and July 2006 at the Heifer International Ranch in Perryville, AR. Goats were supplemented with grass hay and concentrate. Goats were untreated or administered herbal dewormer (n=12\/treatment) according to manufacturer recommendations. FAMACHA scores (1=red or healthy; 5=severely anemic) were determined and fecal samples collected for fecal egg count (FEC) determination every 14 days between Days 0 (day of first herbal treatment) and 112. FAMACHA scores in the herbal treated group were greater than in the untreated control group (P<0.005), indicating a higher level of anemia. FEC were greater for herbal treated goats on Pasture A compared with B by Day 42, but similar among groups thereafter. FEC (P<0.03) and FAMACHA scores (P<0.001) were greater in lactating than in non-lactating goats. Herbal dewormer treatment yielded no measurable health benefits indicating that the herbal dewormer failed to control GIN in these goats.",

The DMSP pictures often show a brightening of the auroral form in coincidence with similar intense electron precipitation at the edges of inverted V structures. Preliminary examination of the S3-3 data has produced only a few such events with a tendency for them to occur at lower altitudes. As a separate topic, a detailed description of a high altitude inverted V structure is presented using S3-3 data. The region contained strong perpendicular electric field structures embedded therein. The potential drop in the region peaks near 16 kV with 10-12 kV below and 4-6 kV above 8000 km. The modification of the electron distributions due to strong electric field structures is analyzed.

The transient absorption is larger in water than in water + acetonitrile (4 : 1) and dimethylformamide (DMF). The difference among them may be attributable to the production of hydrated electrons. The decay process of the transient absorption can be classified roughly into three groups as follows; (1) the fast one decaying within a few picoseconds due to electron–hole recombination in which plural electron–hole pairs participate, (2) the second one with life time of several tens to several hundred picoseconds due to normal electron–hole recombination and (3) the third component concerning with hydrated electrons which does not decay up to several nanoseconds. In DMF, however, the third component was not observed. The relative ratio among three decay components depends on solvents.",

Timing performance is heavily influenced by detector and electronics design. Even for the same scanner design, measured timing resolution is a function of many factors including the activity concentration, geometry and positioning of the radioactive source. Due to lack of measurement standards, the timing resolutions reported in the literature may not be directly comparable and may not describe the timing performance under clinically relevant conditions. In this work we introduce a method which makes use of the data acquired during the standard NEMA NECR measurements, and compare it to several other timing resolution measurement methods. The use of the NEMA NEC phantom, with well-defined dimensions and radioactivity distribution, is attractive because it has been widely accepted in the industry and allows for the characterization of timing resolution across a more relevant range of conditions.",

In particular the motion of particles across a large scale magnetic field is difficult to describe analytically. However, progress has been achieved in the recent years due to the development of the unified non-linear transport theory which can be used to describe magnetic field line diffusion as well as perpendicular diffusion of energetic particles. The latter theory agrees very well with different independently performed testparticle simulations. However, the theory is still based on different approximations and assumptions. In the current article we extend the theory by taking into account the finite gyroradius of the particle motion and calculate corrections in different asymptotic limits. We consider different turbulence models as examples such as the slab model, noisy slab turbulence, and the two-dimensional model. Whereas there are no finite gyroradius corrections for slab turbulence, the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is reduced in the other two cases. The matter investigated in this article is also related to the parameter ”a2” occurring in non-linear diffusion theories.",

Arithmetic mean, weighted mean, t test, F test, Pearson correlation coefficient and Stepwise regression analysis techniques were used in the analysis of the data. The group of the study comprised of 301 parents, including 188 mothers and 113 fathers, who have children with special needs attending the rehabilitation center, mainstream school, lower class and an educational practice school in Konya in 2016. According to research findings, significant relationships were found between these parents’ self-understanding, compassion levels and life satisfaction. Parental compassion level sub-dimensions are significantly associated with compassion, indifference, consciousness of sharing, disconnection, severity of relationship and life satisfaction. Negligence, disconnection and severance, which are the negative dimensions of compassion scale, have negative relationship with life satisfaction, while humaneness and parents with higher scores of sharing, which are the positive dimension of compassion scale, have higher life satisfaction levels. Another important finding is that levels of self-understanding and compassion predict life satisfaction at a meaningful level.

Combination of CA125 and alphaC IFMA values by canonical variate analysis or by multiROC analysis showed that the percentage of all ovarian cancers detected was significantly increased compared with either CA125 or alphaC IFMA alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe alphaC IFMA shows a similar or better specificity compared with the RIA, but with increased sensitivity.

In order to facilitate a better anatomic assessment of questioned specific lower UGT structures, an additional three-dimensional Constructive Interference in Steady State-sequence (3D-CISS) had been acquired in these patients. The final diagnosis was established by all imaging results and surgical or laprascopic findings. The findings from the CISS-sequence were compared to the results from standard MR-urography for complementary anatomic information and conspicuity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDiagnostic 3D-CISS image quality was achieved in all patients. The 3D-CISS confirmed an ectopic ureteral insertion in six patients and reliably excluded ectopic insertion in 10 patients, whereas conventional MR-urography showed an ectopic insertion of the ureter in one case. In six patients with retrovesical complex formations (suspicious for an ectopic cystic renal bud or a cystic genital structure) the 3D-CISS showed increased conspicuity scores for image quality.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe additional 3D-CISS-sequence increases the diagnostic yield in the pelvis in children with complex malformations of the lower UGT such as ectopic ureteral insertion or suspected cystic renal or genital malformations at only minimal additional time, compared to standard MR-urography.",

Patients were investigated on the 7-14, 14-30, 30-90, 90-180, 180-360 and 360- days after OLT. All the patients who received OLT were serum HBV positive before their operations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nKinetic expressions of HBV serum marker and HBV DNA were established. A few patient's HBeAg was negative (8%) before their operation. Within 7 day following surgery, no patient was HBeAg positive. However, the rate of HBeAg positive increased on the 90-180 day following surgery. The postoperation time of taking lamivudine was different between patients with HBeAg seroconversion and of those without (U = 88.5). Peaks occurred within 14 d of HBsAg negative and 14-30 d of anti-HBs positive after operation. Then they decreased and minimized at 90-180 day after liver transplantation. Patients who suffered more bleeding during the operation were more likely to be anti-HBs positive (3800ml vs. 3000ml, U = 8193.0) and HBsAg negative in serum within 2 week (5200ml vs. 4200ml, U = 1648.5) after OLT. While patient's who received more blood transfusion (1000ml vs. 1600ml, U = 9796.0) during operation were not likely to be anti-HBs positive in serum after surgery. Furthermore, the time of infusing HBIg did not affect the state of anti-HBs (U = 1252.5). At the same time, there were no correlations between the change of HBsAg in serum and in the method of operation (chi2 = 0.042). During this process, presentation of anti-HBc changed a little.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe advantages brought on by operative factors become blunt 7-14 d following OLT. More attention should be taken to avoid reinfection of HBV 90-180 day after OLT. Tyrosine-methionine-aspartic acid-aspartic acid (YMDD) mutation of HBV is more likely to occur when taking lamivudine longer. Then, HBV DNA should be monitored and a liver biopsy should be scheduled regularly after OLT.",

Approximately 107 mechanically disrupted cells (with small clumps) of 3 fresh low grade and 6 fresh high grade astrocytomas were seeded on the surface of artificial basement membrane and collagen I wafers (11 × 16 mm). The wafers were then prepared for scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemstry at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after seeding. Regardless of tumor grade, a morphologically similar class of cells was observed to migrate through collagen I gels in 24 hours and 0.5–1.5 mm into artificial basement membrane gels in 7 days. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the migrated cells from low and high grade astrocytomas were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) and expressed cytoplasmic human-specific p185c-neu. These data indicate that fresh human malignant astrocytoma cells that contain GFAP and express cytoplasmic p185c-neu have a high degree of migratory capacity and could be the cell in the tumor involved in intraparenchymal metastasis and poor patient survival in high grade astrocytomas of the human brain.",

For ethical and economic reasons correct assessment of the risk of pressure sores is a prerequisite of adequate prevention of pressure sores. In Germany the Norton scale is one of the most widespread tools for assessing the risk of pressure sores. For practical purposes the original translated version of the Norton scale is in use, as well as an extended modified version. Validity and reliability of these two versions are in the early stages of examination in Germany. The present descriptive longitudinal study aims at determining the predictive value of both versions of the Norton scale in nursing homes. In a convenience sample of 146 individuals from five nursing homes residents from the age of 60 were assessed by professional nursing staff with the aid of both versions of the Norton scale at weekly intervals. Simultaneously the skin status was recorded on both sampling days. The results exhibit high values of sensitivity (91%-95%) and low specificity (6.2%-20.6%) in both scales. Both scales tend to overrate the risk of pressure sores. The values indicate that the original Norton scale assesses the residents free of pressure sores better than its extended version. Because of the convenience-sample the results are not representative and apply only to the investigated setting and population. The predictive validity of the original and modified version of the Norton scale is insufficiently verified, so there is great need of further investigation of the validity of the two versions. Application of assessment scales in nursing should be supplemented by professional expertise of the nursing staff to counterbalance assessment errors of the tools.",

Despite the fact that the safety of the compound has been verified across multiple international studies, evidence for efficacy remains less clear. This may be attributable, at least in part, to several issues, including a lack of randomized clinical trials, a lack of availability of the compound in the United States, and statistical power issues in reported trials. In addition, the fact that CDP‐choline has multiple potential points of therapeutic impact makes it an exciting treatment option in theory but also complicates the analysis of efficacy in the sense that multiple mechanisms and time points must be evaluated. Although some clinical conditions do not appear to benefit from CDP‐choline treatment, the majority of findings to date have suggested at least minor benefits of treatment. In this review we will examine the evidence in the published literature pertaining to use of CDP‐choline in rehabilitation populations and briefly consider the work yet to be done.",

He argues that, although we might still wish to incarcerate such individuals to prevent them inflicting further harm on others, we should be less enthusiastic to blame them for their actions. In many respects, I agree with much of Levy’s treatise. I certainly do not regard ascriptions of blame as useful in my own work with this population. I believe that our goal should be to fully understand the nature of their emotional deficit to be able to treat it similarly to other researchers who work to treat other emotional disorders. To me, Levy’s argument appears sound. However, I offer three considerations and raise questions within these considerations that might further the debate. First, not all rules involve care-based emotional responses to victims. As Levy notes, this is the origin of the moral\/conventional distinction. The problem here is that we do consider someone responsible if they break a conventional transgression. The student talking in class is generally considered blameworthy for this action as long as they knew that the rule of not talking during the lesson applied to that classroom. Yet, there is no victim and no care-based emotional response. Here, the only thing necessary to ascribe blame and responsibility is that the individual knew that a rule exists. Given this holds for conventional transgressions, why must we necessarily make a special case, with respect to responsibility, for moral transgressions? I believe that Levy is fully aware of this concern. He specifically makes reference to moral responsibility and writes that:",

The dependence of both the polarization states and the current of SOA on the formation of dark pulses in the cavity have been carefully investigated, revealing that the output average power of the measured dark pulse is far greater than that of the bright pulse under the same current. Moreover, the evolution process from bright pulse to dark pulse has been studied, showing the role of the extinction ratio of PCs in the transition process.

In addition, bombesin, litorin, physalaemin, and eledoisin each increased the initial uptake of 45Ca by dispersed acinar cells, whereas C-terminal octapeptide of porcine cholecystokinin (CCK-OP) and carbamylcholine did not increase the initial uptake of 45Ca but, rather, abolished the increase caused by the other agents.

Traditional excavation methods are labor intensive and destructive, with limited quantification and repeatability of measurements over time. As a nondestructive geophysical tool for delineating buried features in shallow subsurface, ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been applied for coarse root detection since 1999. This article reviews the state-of-knowledge of coarse root detection and quantification using GPR, and discusses its potentials, constraints, possible solutions, and future outlooks. Some useful suggestions are provided that can guide future studies in this field.ConclusionsThe feasibility and accuracy of coarse root investigation by GPR have been tested in various site conditions (mostly in controlled conditions or within plantations) and for different plant species (mostly tree root systems). Thus far, single coarse root identification and coarse root system mapping have been conducted using GPR, including roots under pavements in urban environment. Coarse root diameter and biomass have been estimated from indexes extracted from root GPR radargrams. Coarse root development can be observed by repeated GPR scanning over time. Successful GPR-based coarse root investigation is site specific, and only under suitable conditions can reliable measurements be accomplished. The best quality of root detection by GPR is achieved in well-drained and electrically-resistive soils (such as sands) under dry conditions. Numerous factors such as local soil conditions, root electromagnetic properties, and GPR antenna frequency can impact the reliability and accuracy of GPR detection and quantification of coarse roots. As GPR design, data processing software, field data collection protocols, and root parameters estimation methods are continuously improved, this noninvasive technique could offer greater potential to study coarse roots.",

These hierarchies are often merely asserted a priori, though systematic studies by Palmer and Krumhansl and Prince and Schmuckler suggest that such hierarchies are also strongly manifest in the relative usage of metrical positions: a strong metrical position is also a frequently used one. If position usage provides an insight into metrical structure, then this may provide a way of engaging with a wider range of metrical structures, including ‘mixed’ metres (5\/8, 7\/8 ) which are excluded by many systems of well-formedness invoked in the canonical studies of ‘simple’ metres (2\/4, 3\/4 ). This article assesses whether position usage in mixed metres is similarly indicative of the metrical structures asserted for them by music theory. The complete set of Bartók’s solo piano works in 7\/8 (223) provides the primary case study repertoire. This is complemented by a look at the more ambiguous 8\/8 (323), as part of considering how position usage might relate to distinctions between syncopation and mixed metre. An introductory discussion of sample size also provides new data and observations for larger corpora of common practice music by Bach.

With the exception of the P29S driver mutation in melanoma, Rac and Cdc42 are not generally mutated in cancer, but are overexpressed (gene amplification and mRNA upregulation) or hyperactivated. Rac and Cdc42 are hyperactivated via signaling through oncogenic cell surface receptors, such as growth factor receptors, which converge on the guanine nucleotide exchange factors that regulate their GDP\/GTP exchange. Hence, targeting Rac and Cdc42 represents a promising strategy for precise cancer therapy, as well as for inhibition of bypass signaling that promotes resistance to cell surface receptor-targeted therapies. Therefore, an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of these pivotal signaling intermediates is key for the development of effective inhibitors.

        "tahun_terbit":2011,
        "abstrak":"Background Little is known about the combined impacts of global environmental changes and ecological disturbances on ecosystem functioning, even though such combined impacts might play critical roles in shaping ecosystem processes that can in turn feed back to climate change, such as soil emissions of greenhouse gases. Methodology\/Principal Findings We took advantage of an accidental, low-severity wildfire that burned part of a long-term global change experiment to investigate the interactive effects of a fire disturbance and increases in CO2 concentration, precipitation and nitrogen supply on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a grassland ecosystem. We examined the responses of soil N2O emissions, as well as the responses of the two main microbial processes contributing to soil N2O production – nitrification and denitrification – and of their main drivers. We show that the fire disturbance greatly increased soil N2O emissions over a three-year period, and that elevated CO2 and enhanced nitrogen supply amplified fire effects on soil N2O emissions: emissions increased by a factor of two with fire alone and by a factor of six under the combined influence of fire, elevated CO2 and nitrogen. We also provide evidence that this response was caused by increased microbial denitrification, resulting from increased soil moisture and soil carbon and nitrogen availability in the burned and fertilized plots. Conclusions\/Significance Our results indicate that the combined effects of fire and global environmental changes can exceed their effects in isolation, thereby creating unexpected feedbacks to soil greenhouse gas emissions. These findings highlight the need to further explore the impacts of ecological disturbances on ecosystem functioning in the context of global change if we wish to be able to model future soil greenhouse gas emissions with greater confidence.",

        "abstrak":"The easiest way to vary the relative adsorption of the sample (and its Rf value, migration rate, respectively) is to change the solvent: strong (polar) eluents decrease adsorption, and weak (no polar) eluents increase it. When benzene, for instance, is used as solvent on silica gels or alumina layers, the ethers and esters are found on top of the chromatogram (with high Rf values), ketones and aldehydes are approximately in the center (medium Rf values), and the alcohols are below them (low Rf values), whereas the acids remain at the starting point (Rf 1⁄4 0). Thus the separation sequence follows the polarities of the compounds. The dielectric constant may be taken as an indication of solvent polarity, but the interfacial tension between solvents and polar adsorbents, approximated by the interfacial tension between the solvent and water, has been suggested as a fundamental basis for correlating solvent strength. The physical factors that determine solvent strength in a given adsorption system have long been understood in general terms. Solvent strength can be interpreted in terms of the following basic contributions: 1) interactions between solvent molecules and a sample molecule in solution; 2) interactions between solvent molecules and a sample molecule in the adsorbed phase; and 3) interactions between an adsorbed solvent molecule and the adsorbent.",

The possibility of precise control of changes of process conditions is of particular importance for multi step processes as nucleation, particle growth, particle aggregation and formation of shells. So, for example, different size, shape and optical properties of plasmonic Au\/Ag particles can be addressed by tuning the conditions of microfluidic synthesis. \n \nIn addition, the micro segmented flow allows an efficient screening of large sets of reaction conditions by the definition of individual parameter sets in single nanoliter fluid segments. Two- three-, four- and five-dimensional concentration spaces are addressed by the application of computer-controlled syringe pumps for combinatorial experiments with several thousands single reaction volumes. The individual micro fluid segments with special reaction mixtures can be distinguished by their number in the segment sequence. The complete sets of synthesized colloidal solutions of nanoparticles were characterized by micro flow-through photometry and spectrophotometry.

Here we show, in general accord with predictions from the dopamine re-selection hypothesis [Redgrave and Gurney (2006). Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 7, 967-975], that systemic amphetamine greatly enhanced the performance of lever press responses that delivered a visual stimulus whether that stimulus had been paired with reward or not. In contrast, amphetamine had no effect on the performance of responses on an inactive lever that had no stimulus consequences. These results support the notion that dopaminergic activity serves to mark or tag actions associated with stimulus change for subsequent selection (or re-selection) and stand against the more specific suggestion that dopaminergic activity is solely related to the prediction of reward.",

        "abstrak":"The Malmedy Massacre: The War Crimes Trial Controversy, Steven P. Remy (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2017), viii + 342 pp., hardcover $29.95, electronic version available. On December 17, 1944, during the opening days of the Battle of the Bulge, a Kampfgruppe (battle group) from the 1 SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) murdered a group of captured American soldiers at the Baugnez crossroads near the town of Malmedy, Belgium. An investigation of the massacre and the battle group’s other atrocities led to a trial known as the Malmedy Case. The U.S. Army prosecuted the Sixth SS Panzer Army commander, SS-Oberstgruppenführer Josef “Sepp” Dietrich; the battle group commander, SS-Obersturmbannführer Joachim Peiper; and other officers and enlisted men of the unit. The proceedings took place at Dachau. The prosecution argued that Dietrich had ordered the German spearhead to employ the most extreme measures, and that Peiper and his subordinates faithfully carried out their commander’s order, making theirs one of the rare (though not unique) SS units that applied brutal Eastern Front practices in Western Europe. The defense maintained that there had been no order to depart from international law, and that any killings were the result of “heat of battle” confusion and the desperate situation facing the hard-pressed German forces. In July 1946, seventy-three of the defendants were found guilty; forty-three, including Peiper, received death sentences. Subsequently, a new narrative argued that although the Kampfgruppe undoubtedly had killed American POWs, the trial and verdicts were tainted by gross investigative and prosecutorial misconduct. Lurid reports of savage beatings, death threats, mock trials and executions, and extorted confessions appeared in both the German and American press. Multiple investigations followed. Amnesty campaigns from diverse quarters gathered momentum. By early 1957, every Malmedy defendant, even those facing death sentences, had been released. Steven P. Remy, author of the well-regarded The Heidelberg Myth: The Nazification and Denazification of a German University (2002), takes a critical look at this apparent case of “victor’s justice” gone awry. He carefully analyzes the various efforts to seek amnesty for the Malmedy defendants and to influence the reviews and investigations of the trial and verdict. These began with the defense counsel, Colonel Willis Everett, who went public with accusations of prisoner abuse and prosecutorial misconduct. Remy deftly outlines the various political currents that fueled criticism of the trials, especially German resentment of denazification and the perceived shame of foreign occupation. He also highlights individuals advocating for the defendants: leading German clergy (both Catholic and Protestant) attempting to conduct a “rescue action,” ex-Wehrmacht personnel seeking to restore German national honor, and various political opportunists hoping to further their own purposes.",

        "judul":"EMC Assurance Measurements of Industrial Facilities",
        "tahun_terbit":1983,
        "abstrak":"This paper begins by noting that compliance with Parts 15 and 18 of the FCC Rules does not alone provide assurance that a facility using elec­ trical and electronic equipment is free of poten­ tially harmful radio frequency emissions. Recogniz­ ing this, standards and procedures are discussed which might be used to provide such assurance. Illustrations are included of actual spectral mea­ surements made inside and outside of a large indus­ trial complex. Recommendations are made for whole facility testing which might be done without speci­ fic knowledge of the exact location or even the existence of possible interfering sources. THE NEED FOR FACILITY LEVEL CERTIFICATION A large industrial facility may employ a variety of equipment that generate and use radio frequency energy. The managers of such a facility can comply with the FCC Rules limiting unauthorized RF emanations by making certain that no equipments covered by Part 15 or 18 of the Rules are operating in the facility without having been granted appro­ priate FCC approval. However, this alone may not guarantee the absence of electrical interference which may be harmful to a radio navigation or com­ munication service. Defective equipment, equipment not operated in the approved manner, and unsus­ pected (and therefore unapproved) sources may con­ tribute to an undesirable level of sp.ectral pollu­ tion. It is the purpose of this presentation to consider whether it is feasible to certify an entire facility, building, or complex containing a multiplicity of interfering sources, and to what standards it should be certified. The purpose of the certification would be to provide reasonable assurance that, beyond the strict requirements for FCC approval of specific items and classes of equipment, a facility meets the intent of the FCC for limiting potentially harmful radio frequency interference. Referring EMI measurements to the perimeter of the premises containing ISM equipments rather than to specific pieces of equipment is not a new con­ cept, The Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordi­ nating Council (AFTRCC), which is composed of major aerospace manufacturers, noted in its response to the Docket 20718 Notice of Inquiry (1) that a single manufacturer may have as many as 300 items of ISM equipment of all types and sizes. Further noting that buildings of an industrial complex would tend to \"shield\" or \"block\" radiation, AFTRCC strongly urged the Commission to adopt a \"yard\" or \"premises\" approach as permitted in Section 4.3.1 of CISPR Publication 11.(2). In a later response to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (3) in the same docket, AFTRCC reiterated its position that \"The Commission should provide for Yard Area certi­ fication as an alternative to test site or on-site measurement.\" Bethlehem Steel Corporation, also responding to the Docket 20718 Notice of Proposed Rule Making proposed to include the following statement: \"Where Equipment Under Test (EUT) is located in a building within continuous boundaries of a fenced in exclu­ sively industrial complex wholly under control of the operator of the EUT, measurements should be made at a distance of 30 meters from the perimeter of the complex.\" The IEEE Industrial Electronics and Control Instrumentation Group's High Frequency Heating Com­ mittee proposed that Paragraph 18.108 of the FCC Rules, which permits certification as a unit of a group of similar equipments contained within a cir­ cle not exceeding a radius of 500 ft. be amended to include all equipment in a large building with no 500 ft. radius limitation. The committee further suggested that the radiation measurements be made at locations with reference to the boundary line of the property, as suggested by CISPR, rather than the boundary limit of the building containing the equipment. General Electric, noting that the industrial environment is under control of the management of the plant, also recommended to the Commission that the appropriate point for specifying emission limits is the plant boundary. AT&T indicated that it favors measurements at building perimeters. Though not extended to \"yard\" or \"premises\" certification, the Notice, of Proposed Rulemaking, Docket 20718 does provide for ISM-registration mea­ surements to be made at the user's premises when size, power requirements or other special consider­ ation makes measurements at an approved test site impractical. In such cases distances are to be CH1838-2\/83\/0000-0258 $1.00 © 1983 IEEE 258 measured from the perimeter of the building in which the equipment is installed (Note 1 of the proposed amendment to 18.108). PROBLEMS OF FACILITY LEVEL MEASUREMENTS Identification of ISM Emission Referring EMC measurements to the perimeters of buildings or even to the boundaries of industrial property totally under the control of the user is an approach with considerable merit. As a practi­ cal procedure, it is likely to prove costly and inefficient. First, if the measurements are meant to cover all possible sources of unauthorized emis­ sions, then no assumptions concerning frequencies sought can be made. The entire spectrum of inter­ est must be searched. Secondly, this search must be made in the presence of many hundreds of emis­ sions normally found in an outdoor electromagnetic environment. Every emission encountered which exceeds a predetermined level must be analyzed at least to the extent necessary to establish that it is either a licensed transmission or coming from a source outside the user's premises. This kind of effort can be very time consuming. Measurement Examples An electromagnetic field survey was made under the direction of the author at a large industrial facility in North Carolina in late 1982 and early 1983. The purpose of the survey was to show that the plant, which uses a wide varity of ISM equip­ ment, was operating within the intent of the FCC Rules covering ISM and incidental radiation devi­ ces. To provide a baseline for comparison with later measurements, spectrum scans were made at several points around the periphery of the plant during the Thanksgiving weekend. All manufacturing operations were shut down during this period. Therefore, the measurement results show only the electromagnetic environment in which unauthorized emissions, if present, must be found. Measurements were made with the test set-up illustrated in Fig­ ure 1. Sections of the spectrum were scanned using a Hewlett Packard 141T Spectrum Analyzer. The re­ sults were recorded with a Hewlett Packard 7054A X-Y Recorder. Typical results of the baseline spectrum plots are shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4 for 500 1000 kHz, 10—30 MHz and 100-200 MHz. All were made at the same point just outside the boundary of the facil­ ity and identified as \"location 5\" on the plots. The vertical scale is in terms of dBm at the output of the test antenna. The equivalent values in field strength may be calculated from a knowledge of the antenna factors. Field strength levels of 200 ]N\/m (Figures 2 and 3), and 30 pV\/m (Figure 4) are shown corresponding to the limits at 30m proposed in the Docket 20718 Notice of Proposed Rule Making. Normally, the certification of individual items of equipment requires measurements in close proximity to the equipment to find the significant emission frequencies. Thereafter, only these fre­ quencies need be observed to determine levels at distances specified in Part 18 of The Commission's Rules. If a search is being made with no prior knowledge of the emissions sought, the task is obviously much more difficult. Yet another problem is the time variant nature of both the ISM emissions sought and the background emissions tending to mask them. The AM broadcast band, a part of which is depicted in Figure 2, is reasonably stable. However the 10 to 30 MHz HF spectrum shown in Figure 3 is in a constant state of change, even over a period as short as a few minutes. Signals increase and decrease with the fading characteristics of the ionosphere. Figure 4 includes the VHF high band mobile radio band which can be even more difficult to interpret. Mobile radio signals pop up and disappear as users key their transmitters. This can mask ISM emissions which may also appear and disappear if associated with equipment used intermittently. EFFECTS OF BUILDING ATTENUATION Inside and Outside Measurements The attenuation of electromagnetic emissions in both directions by most industrial buildings can be used to advantage in an electromagnetic survey of such buildings. The outside electromagnetic envi­ ronment is attenuated inside. Further, by depend­ ing upon the attenuation of the building to reduce ISM emissions generated on the inside, higher limits can be tolerated. The two effects combined can greatly reduce the task of finding above limit out-of-band ISM emissions. Figures 5 and 6 will serve to illustrate. Both are X-Y plots of the 500-1000 kHz segment of spectrum made at the North Carolina site previously referred to. Figure 5 was made outside of a large manufac turing building identified as Building C in Figure 7. Figure 6 was made inside Building C at the location shown in Figure 7. The building is of steel and concrete block construction. The three AM signals identi­ fied can be seen to be attenuated from 22 to 38 dB. Table 1 shows a similar comparison of attenua­ tion observed inside three separate buildings, identified as Building A, B, and C in Figure 7. Each is compared to the outside reference point shown. All three building were of steel and con­ crete block construction. The comparisons were made at six frequencies from high powered transmit­ ters at distances large compared to the dimensions of the complex. At each site the test antennas were rotated to provide measurements for each of four directions: north, east, south, and west. Comparisons are made of the highest received level for each frequency at each site. Not unexpectedly, the building attenuations recorded in Table 1 vary widely, i.e., from 12 to 51 d",

        "abstrak":"PolyDADMAC (PD) is a high charge density cationic polymer of diallyldimethylammonium chloride which has been recently developed as a coagulant in water purification. As PD has high affinity to fine negatively-charged colloids, it is worth to ascertain if PD can affect surface properties of clay-size particles in red mud waste and be applied to develop immobilization techniques for red mud storage areas. In the current study, a test tube method in combination with surface charge measurement was used for determination of the colloidal properties of a red mud sample under the variation of PD, soluble Al and Si, and variable pH conditions. Observations for the PD concentration range from 0.25 to 2.0 mM revealed that PD can increase surface charge and enhance aggregation or at least shift the aggregation zone to higher pH. This suggests a possible application of PD for immobilization of red mud in alkaline condition. It was also found that soluble Al and Si acted to modify the effect of PD and aggregation properties of red mud. While soluble Si supported aggregation, Al appeared as an enhancer for dispersion of red mud. It implies that development of PD-based techniques for immobilization of red mud needs to consider the effects of soluble Al and Si.",

Thus, SME was used as the dependent variable against which NIR data were calibrated. A correlation coefficient of 0.99 and standard error of calibration of 11 kJ\/kg were achieved on products based on wholemeal wheat flour.

An important strategy of creating films with high crystallinity is through epitaxial growth on a proper single crystal substrate. We report the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition of epitaxial CdTe films on the CdS\/mica substrate. The epitaxial CdS film was grown on a mica surface by thermal evaporation. Due to the weak van der Waals forces, epitaxy is achieved despite the very large interface lattice mismatch between CdS and mica (∼21–55%). The surface morphology of mica, CdS and CdTe were quantified by atomic force microscopy. The near surface structures, orientations and texture of CdTe and CdS films were characterized by the unique reflection high-energy electron diffraction surface pole figure technique. The interfaces of CdTe and CdS films and mica were characterized by X-ray pole figure technique and transmission electron microscopy. The out-of-plane and in-plane epitaxy of the heteroepitaxial films stack are determined to be CdTe(111)\/\/CdS(0001)\/\/mica(001) and [ 1 ¯ 2 1 ¯ ]CdTe\/\/[ 1 ¯ 100]CdS\/\/[010]mica, respectively.

Although many patients benefit from the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy, a favourable response is not achieved in approximately 30% of cases. This sets a prerequisite to better understand the response and resistance mechanisms of rituximab. To do so, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of one rituximab unresponsive and two responsive DLBCL cell lines. In the responsive cells, rituximab affected the expression of genes related to apoptosis, lymphocyte signaling and cytokine response. Our data show rituximab-response to be associated with gene expression in classical signaling cascades involved in cell growth and differentiation, such as previously identified MAPK and completely novel Wnt and TGF-β pathways. Furthermore, our findings support earlier observations that rituximab can induce direct apoptosis and suggest the cell of origin to be associated with the cellular outcome. After validation of cellular results, we used a cohort of 233 R-CHOP treated DLBCL patients and found several of the most differentiating genes to have impact on survival. Together, the results provide an advanced picture of the CD20 mediated signaling of DLBCL cells and may provide new targets in future treatment protocols.",

In the colonic mucosa in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis the enzyme level was diminished when there was loss of epithelial cells in the mucosa, although not when there was just loss of goblet cells. In patients recovering from an acute attack of ulcerative colitis, the enzyme levels rose to a peak above the normal range, an effect which did not occur in patients who did not recover promptly. This recovery peak may be related to the synthesis of gastrointestinal mucus, or immunoglobulin, or the secretory component of IgA, all of which contain large amounts of N-acetylglucosamine.",

In comparison with bacterial and eukaryal Lon proteases, the biology of the archaeal Lon has been studied to a limited extent. In this study, the gene encoding the Lon protease of the alkaliphilic haloarchaeon Natrialba magadii (Nmlon) was cloned and sequenced, and the genetic organization of Nmlon was examined at the transcriptional level. Nmlon encodes a 84 kDa polypeptide with a pI of 4.42 which contains the ATPase, protease and membrane targeting domains of the archaeal-type LonB proteases. Nmlon is part of an operon that encodes membrane proteases and it is transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA in N. magadii cells at different growth stages. Accordingly, NmLon was detected in cell membranes of N. magadii throughout growth by Western blot analysis using specific anti-NmLon antibodies. Interestingly, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, purified NmLon bound double stranded as well as single stranded DNA in the presence of elevated salt concentrations. This finding shows that DNA-binding is conserved in the LonA and LonB subfamilies and suggests that Lon-DNA interaction may be relevant for its function in haloarchaea.",

        "abstrak":"Introduction rTMS with narrow focus coils is able to stimulate or inhibit depolarization in circumscribed cerebral areas. However, it is difficult to position the coil over the skull precisely above the target gyrus. Orientation on the 10–20-EEG system or calculation of bone markers of the skull in MRI imaging with transfer of the data to the skull of the living patient has been used to position the coil manually. These procedures are rather imprecise. We here present a system which coordinates the MRI imaging of the brain with an infrared camera system guided robot to position the coil directly over the region of interest (ROI). Protocol 5 patients have been included into this protocol. A T1-MRI of the brain was used to identify the ROI, here the precentral motor area of the hand (handknob). The sedantary patient was placed into a relaxing chair and small passive sphere markers (head reference markers) were fixed to the head by a headband. These skull markers were tracked by an infrared camera system positioned in front of and above the patient’s head in a distance of about 1.3 m and correlated to the cerebral MRI imaging. A robot system (Smart Move R , ANT) with a 6 joint metal arm allowing positioning of the coil with 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) was placed beside the patient. The magnetic coil (8-shaped) was fixed to the robot arm. The infrared camera system identified the position of the magnetic coil and the patient’s head by the passive sphere markers fixed to the magnetic coil and the patient. The MRI data were stored into a PC and the surface image of the brain was coordinated with the position of the patient’s skull and of the magnetic coil. By this technique, it was possible to identify the ROI of the cortex and direct the coil precisely by the robot arm over the skull area of the underlying ROI. Results Immediate correct position of the coil manoeuvred by the robot arm over the ROI was successfully controlled by rTMS of the precentral hand knob and surface electromyography of the contralateral hand muscles. Summary It is possible to manoeuvre precisely a magnetic coil for rTMS over brain tissue of interest using a robot arm by coordinating the cortical surface MRI of the patient with the skull and the magnetic coil. Registration of the positions is achieved by an infrared camera system. The robot arm is able to follow the head during limited movements.",

The identification of the Poisson’s ratio, however, is much more challenging, since most frequencies are not sufficiently sensitive to it. The present work addresses this problem by determining the test specimen specifications that create the optimal conditions for the identification of the Poisson’s ratio. Two methods are suggested for the determination of the Poisson’s ratio of orthotropic materials: the first employs the resonant frequencies of a plate-shaped specimen, while the second uses the resonant frequencies of a set of beam-shaped specimens.

The product is produced by fermentation of ripened sun-dried Grewia flava (Malvaceae) fruits supplemented with brown table sugar. Despite its popularity, its growing consumer acceptance, its potential nutritional value, and its contribution to the socio-economic lifestyle of Botswana, the production process remains non-standardized. Non-standardized production processes lead to discrepancies in product quality and safety as well as varying shelf life. Identification of unknown fermentative microorganisms of khadi is an important step towards standardization of its brewing process for entrance into commercial markets. The aim of this study was to isolate and identify bacteria and yeasts responsible for fermentation of khadi. Yeasts and bacteria harbored in 18 khadi samples from 18 brewers in central and northern Botswana were investigated using classic culture-dependent techniques and DNA sequencing methods. Additionally, we used the same techniques to investigate the presence of bacteria and yeasts on six batches of ripened-dried G. flava fruits used for production of the sampled brews. Our results revealed that Saccharomyces cerevisiae closely related to a commercial baker’s yeast strain sold locally was the most predominant yeast species in khadi suggesting a possible non-spontaneous brewing process. However, we also detected diverse non-Saccharomyces yeasts, which are not available commercially in retail shops in Botswana. This suggests that spontaneous fermentation is partially responsible for fermentation of khadi. This study, presenting the first microbiological characterization of a prominent traditional alcoholic beverage in Botswana, is vital for development of starter cultures for the production of a consistent product towards the commercialization of khadi.",

Specifically, we examine a recent failed attempt of the Chinese authorities at establishing a go-it-alone mercantilist policy relating to IT infrastructure in the wake of internal divisions and strong foreign opposition. We argue in this case that the clash between the pro-open and nationalist\/mercantilist forces shaped the policymaking process, whilst the international factors underpinned the direction of policy change by tipping the power balance towards the liberal reformers through China's unique institutional arrangements.",

        "abstrak":"Computer models are now widely used across a range of scientific disciplines to describe various complex physical systems, however to perform full uncertainty quantification we often need to employ emulators. An emulator is a fast statistical construct that mimics the complex computer model, and greatly aids the vastly more computationally intensive uncertainty quantification calculations that a serious scientific analysis often requires. In some cases, the complex model can be solved far more efficiently for certain parameter settings, leading to boundaries or hyperplanes in the input parameter space where the model is essentially known. We show that for a large class of Gaussian process style emulators, multiple boundaries can be formally incorporated into the emulation process, by Bayesian updating of the emulators with respect to the boundaries, for trivial computational cost. The resulting updated emulator equations are given analytically. This leads to emulators that possess increased accuracy across large portions of the input parameter space. We also describe how a user can incorporate such boundaries within standard black box GP emulation packages that are currently available, without altering the core code. Appropriate designs of model runs in the presence of known boundaries are then analysed, with two kinds of general purpose designs proposed. We then apply the improved emulation and design methodology to an important systems biology model of hormonal crosstalk in Arabidopsis Thaliana.",

        "abstrak":"INTERGOVERNMENTAL commodity agreements were seriously considered at the World Monetary and Economic Conference in London in June--July, 1933, primarily as means to facilitate recovery from severe economic depression. The role of such agreements in the postwar world was an important issue at the United Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture at Hot Springs in May-June, I943. During this decade and subsequently, able minds have wrestled with relevant problems of principle, policy, and practice, and some approach to a consensus is in process of being hammered out. This subject will be on the agenda of the International Conference on Trade and Employment, which is proposed to be held in I946.' Experience with multilateral intergovernmental commodity agreements (conveniently abbreviated \"I.C.A.'s\") has been limited rather than extensive. On the whole, it has yielded more warnings than promise. But so varied have been the tvnes and the degrees of success that this body of experience merits scrutiny. Only scant reference to it appears in the valuable book in which the International Labour Office published a collection of relevant documents, together with an introductory review of the literature (through early I943) and an analysis of the problems of international commodity control.2 The tea-, tin-, and rubber-control authorities each subsequently published an extensive review of its operations over a decade. These I.C.A.'s and a few others have been more or less intensively analyzed by various scholars. Enough ignorance and misunderstanding nevertheless persist, even in quarters usually well informed, to warrant the presentation of an orderly summary of I.C.A. experience to the end of I945.",

        "abstrak":"As one approach to analysing the genetic barriers between species, we studied the numbers and types of parasitic worms in two species of house mice (Mus musculus and M. domesticus) and in their natural hybrids. Where the ranges of these two species meet in southern Germany, there is a zone of hybridization less than 20 kilometres across1, in which about 98% of the mice have backcross genotypes. Fourteen of the 46 mice tested from within the zone have over 500 pinworms per gut, a number far exceeding the mean of 40 per gut for other mice inside and outside the zone. Other nematodes have a similar, non-random distribution. The number of mice bearing 9 or more tapeworms per gut is also excessive in the hybrid zone. These extraordinarily wormy mice may be unusually susceptible to parasitism; the different species may have different genes for resistance, and recombinant backcross animals may lose both2. Our findings support the view that the hybrid populations may have reduced fitness and thereby act as a genetic sink, interfering with the flow of genes between the two species1,3. The possibility that environmental or ecological peculiarities in the zone of hybridization make the mice more liable to infection is not supported.",

        "tahun_terbit":2017,
        "abstrak":"This work makes use of a biomechanical model of speech production as a reference subject to address several phenomena related to the adaptability and stability of speech motor control, namely motor equivalence and postural stability. The first part of this thesis is related to the phenomenon of motor equivalence. Motor equivalence is a key feature of speech motor control, since speakers must constantly adapt to various phonetic contexts and speaking conditions. The Uncontrolled Manifold (UCM) idea offers a theoretical framework for considering motor equivalence in which coordination among motor control variables is separated into two subspaces, one in which changes in control variables modify the output and another one in which these changes do not influence the output.This concept is developed and investigated for speech production using a 2D biomechanical model. First, a representation of the linearized UCM based on orthogonal projection matrices is proposed. The UCMs of various vocal tract configurations of the 10 French oral vowels are then characterized using their command perturbation responses. It is then investigated whether each phonetic class such as phonemes, front\/back vowels, rounded\/un-rounded vowels can be characterized by a unique UCM, or whether the UCMs vary significantly across representatives of these different classes. It was found that linearized UCMs, especially those that are specifically computed for each configuration, but also across many of the phonetic classes allow for a command perturbation response that is effective. This suggests that similar motor equivalence strategies can be implemented within each of these classes and that UCMs provide a valid characterization of an equivalence strategy. Further work is suggested to elaborate which classes might be used in practice.The second part addresses the question of the degree to which postural control of the tongue is accomplished through passive mechanisms - such as the mechanical and elastic properties of the tongue itself - or through short-latency reflexes - such as the stretch reflex.A specific external force perturbation, was applied to the 2D biomechanical model , namely one in which the tongue is pulled anteriorly using specific force profile exerted on the tongue body using a force effector attached to the superior part of the tongue blade. Simulation results were compared to experimental data collected at Gipsa-lab under similar conditions.This perturbation was simulated with various values of the model's parameter modulating the reflex strength (feedback gain). The results showed that a perturbation rebound seen in simulated data is due to a reflex mechanism. Since a compatible rebound is seen in data from human subjects, this can be taken as evidence of a reflex mechanism being involved in postural stability of the tongue. The time course of the mechanisms of this reflex, including the generation of force and the movement of the tongue, were analyzed and it was determined that the precision of the model was insufficient to make any conclusions on the origin of this reflex (whether cortical or brainstem). Still, numerous experimental directions are proposed.",

AC activity was determined in basal and stimulated conditions via stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding proteins (Gs) using GTP, or directly with forskolin. Basal AC activity was reduced in brains from PiD cases. This agrees with the decrease in AC type I (AC I) level detected by Western blotting. However, inhibition of forskolin‐stimulated AC activity by a selective A1R agonist was significantly increased in brains from PiD. In occipital cortex, adenosine A1R numbers were similar in control and PiD cases, and no significant differences were found in A1R‐mediated AC inhibition.

Script recognition techniques are classified into three categories: firstly, segmentation-free methods or holistic approaches, that compare a sequence of observations derived from whole word image with similar references of words in the small lexicon. Secondly, segmentation-based methods, that look for the best match between consecutive sequences of primitive segments and letters of a possible word similar to human-like reading technique, in which secure features found all over the word are used to boot-strap a few candidates for a final evaluation phase; thirdly, hybrid approaches. Additionally, different feature extraction techniques are elaborated in conjunction with the classification process. In this scenario, implications of single and multiple classifiers are also observed. Finally, remaining problems are highlighted along with possible suggestion and strategies to solve them.",

Much of the difficulty in correcting these problems stems from the relative lack of process data available in SLS machines. Because of these issues, part validation and improved process sensors and control continue to be identified as critical areas of improvement in industry roadmaps. In this paper the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as an in-situ sensor is explored for the SLS process. Specifically, curl is induced in SLS parts during the build process and OCT is used to detect the defect during the build process. Limitations of OCT for curl detection are discussed. Additionally, OCT is found to be able to identify pores within the molten part under some build conditions by comparing OCT data with micro x-ray computed tomography (XCT) data.",

Comparison of the GMC guidelines with the more sensible British Medical Association guidance reveals that both are biased in favour of NTC and subvert standard consent procedures. It is further argued that any doctor who does participate in NTC of a minor may be guilty of negligence and in breach of the Human Rights Act.

Hyphae from nonmound mycelial regions yield monokaryotic types identical to those originally used to form the dikaryons. In hyphae from mound-forming regions, however, homoallelism of the mnd allele has been demonstrated; the nuclear type that formerly contained the mnd(+) allele acquired a mnd allele.-The process of internuclear transfer or recombination is unaccompanied by the simultaneous alteration of any additional genetic markers carried by the recipient nucleus.

Hybrid structures were compared with their natural components by means of circular dichroism, and their biologic activities were compared by using T-cell proliferation assays. Their IgE-binding activity was determined with Western blotting, skin prick tests, and enzyme allergosorbent and ELISA inhibition tests.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe hybrid proteins, especially Q2 and Q3, revealed significantly reduced IgE reactivity compared with the natural allergens, as well as with the whole P judaica extract. Furthermore, in vivo skin prick tests showed that the hybrid proteins had a significantly lower potency to induce cutaneous reactions than the whole P judaica extract. Two (Q1 and Q2) of the 3 hybrid proteins induced a comparable T-cell proliferation response as that produced by the whole extract and natural allergens.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nConsidering its reduced anaphylactogenic potential, together with its conserved T-cell reactivity, the engineered Q2 protein could be used in safe and shortened schedules of allergen-specific immunotherapy against P judaica pollen allergy.\n\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\nRecombinant hybrid Q2 is able to induce T-cell proliferation, thus evidencing a potential therapeutic effect.

RLS severity was assessed using the IRLSSG Severity Rating Scale. RESULTS: In total, 78 patients with RLS, including 50 (64.1%) primary and 28 (35.9%) secondary cases, were examined. Of the primary cases, 35 (70%) were male; of the secondary cases, 25 (89.3%) were female (P < 0.001). Multivariate regression confirmed the association of male gender with primary RLS (odds ratio = 14.53, 95% confidence interval [2.9–75], P = 0.001). There were more dark- and black-skinned participants in the primary RLS group (38, 72%) than in the secondary group (15, 28%) (P = 0.042). Iron deficiency was observed in most (26, 92%) of the secondary cases. More severe symptoms were reported in secondary than in primary RLS cases (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Primary RLS is more common but less severe than secondary RLS. Male gender and ethnicity play significant roles in primary RLS, whereas female gender and iron deficiency may be the main risk factors associated with secondary RLS.",

        "abstrak":"It has been proven that Transit Signal Priority (TSP) strategies can reduce bus travel time as well as increase bus service reliability. Nonetheless, some major issues remain. The performance of TSP strategies may significantly increase traffic control delay if the TSP requests are frequent. Or TSP may further deteriorate the traffic conditions or even cause cycle failures at congested intersections. In this paper, the authors examined and estimated the potential performance of TSP under different scenarios composed of various signal control strategies and traffic demand levels. The authors also conducted a case study using the microscopic traffic simulation software, VISSIM, which contains a fully-functioned signal control emulator with a TSP module. The comparison between TSP and non-TSP strategies in simulation demonstrates that TSP strategies are not necessarily beneficial for all traffic scenarios. The comparison also explores the benefits of TSP with respect to the total traffic volumes, demand distributions and frequency of TSP requests at intersections. Lastly, the authors conducted a simulation study of a bus corridor of the City of Edmonton to identify intersections which can benefit from TSP. The simulation results show that TSP will reduce bus travel times as well as deteriorate the overall traffic performance. Disabling some of the TSP control may result in greater balance for the whole system. (A) For the covering abstract of this conference see ITRD record number 201310RT334E.",

We report here the results obtained from a first broad-scale survey of arthropods in BTNR. The focus was on insects because Singapore’s insect fauna remains largely unknown despite the fact that insects constitute much of the animal biomass and perform many ecologically important tasks. The survey relied on specimens collected with passive traps (e.g., Malaise traps) that were set along several transects in primary and different types of secondary forests. Specimens representing several thousand species were obtained. In order to process the specimens rapidly, we sorted them based on DNA sequences of the COI gene. Sequences for more than 9,000 specimens were obtained and the DNA data were used to group the specimens into putative species. Here, we compare the species numbers, composition, and species overlap between secondary and primary forests for “true bugs” (Hemiptera). Overall, the sequences belonged to more than 1850 insect species of which ca. 450 belonged to Hemiptera. A very large proportion of the “true bug” species are only represented by 1 or 2 specimens each and we find that BTNR’s species diversity is much higher than the diversity in mangroves and on the National University of Singapore (NUS) campus. We also report and illustrate some notable insect species found during the survey.

These components are allocated with the objective of maximising the system reliability. There are three methods developed in this paper. The first method is developed by formulating the problem mathematically. The second method involves enumeration of all possible allocations of a given number of i.i.d. components. The third method is a heuristic, based on component reliability importance. The accuracy of the heuristic is established by comparing it with the second method.

The early rationale for ceramic biomaterials was based upon the chemical and biochemical inertness (minimal bioreactivity) of elemental compounds constituted into structural forms (materials). Subsequently, mildly reactive (bioactive), and partially and fully degradable ceramics were identified for clinical uses. Structural forms have included bulk solids or particulates with and without porosities for tissue ingrowth, and more recently, coatings onto other types of biomaterial substrates. The physical shapes selected were application dependent, with advantages and disadvantages determined by: (1) the basic material and design properties of the device construct; and (2) the patient-based functional considerations. Most of the ceramics (bioceramics) selected in the 1960s and 1970s have continued over the long-term, and the science and technology for thick and thin coatings have evolved significantly over the past decade. Applications of ceramic biomaterials range from bulk (100%) ceramic structures as joint and bone replacements to fully or partially biodegradable substrates for the controlled delivery of pharmaceutical drugs, growth factors, and morphogenetically inductive substances. Because of the relatively unique properties of bioceramics, expanded uses as structural composites with other biomaterials and macromolecular biologically-derived substances are anticipated in the future.",

Irinotecan in combination with other chemotherapy regimens has been investigated in multiple tumour types. Encapsulation of irinotecan in liposomal nanoparticles (nanoliposomal irinotecan) renders this compound more stable and prolongs its persistence in the circulation, thereby increasing its levels intratumourally. In a phase II study in 40 patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy, nanoliposomal irinotecan had promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile. This prompted Li-Tzong Chen and co-authors to conduct an open-label, multicentre, phase III trial (NAPOLI-1) to assess the effect of nanoliposomal irinotecan alone and in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus folinic acid in a similar patient population. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 120 mg\/ m2 nanoliposomal irinotecan (equivalent to 100 mg\/m2 irinotecan free base) every 3 weeks or 5-FU plus folinic acid weekly for 4 weeks in a 6-week cycle. Safety data from a concurrent study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with the combination of 80 mg\/m2 nanoliposomal irinotecan, 5-FU and folinic acid every 2 weeks was demonstrated, so the protocol was amended to add this regimen as a third arm. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate, change in levels of CA19-9, and safety. Patients treated with the nanoliposomal irinotecan combination regimen demonstrated a significant increase in median overall survival versus 5-FU plus folinic acid alone (6.1 months versus 4.2 months). The nanoliposomal irinotecan combination also improved PFS, compared with 5-FU plus folinic acid (median 3.1 months versus 1.5 months). Chen comments on the key findings: “To date, this is the largest phase III study in metastatic pancreatic cancer of post gemcitabine-based therapy. Nanoliposomal irinotecan in combination with 5-FU and folinic acid represents a potential treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with progression after a gemcitabine-based regimen.” Lisa Hutchinson",

We find that reliable inferences in the absence of the mothers' profiles require many more STR loci than the 10-25 loci that are currently routinely available. However, profiling the two mothers conveys more discriminatory power than profiling the same number of additional loci in the individuals themselves.

        "abstrak":"Knowledge of the ability of the female reproductive system to metabolize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is critical to the diagnosis and management of female infertility and for risk assessment purposes. The PAHs are a family of widespread pollutants that are released into the environment from automobile exhausts, cigarette smoke, burning of refuse, industrial emissions, and hazardous waste sites. In exposed animals, PAHs become activated to reactive metabolites that interfere with target organ function and as a consequence cause toxicity. The extent of susceptibility to PAH exposure may depend on the ability of animals to metabolize these chemicals. The present study has been undertaken to assess whether any differences exist among mammals in the metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a prototypical PAH compound. Microsomes isolated from the liver and ovaries of rats, mice, goats, sheep, pigs, and cows were incubated with 5 μM BaP. Postincubation, samples were extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed for BaP\/metabolites by reverse‐phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. The rate of metabolism (pmol of metabolite\/min\/mg protein) was found to be more in liver than in ovary in all the species studied (P < 0.05). The differences in metabolite concentrations were statistically significant (P < 0.0001) among the various species in both organs studied. Multiple species comparison also revealed that the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001) between rodents (rat and mouse) and higher mammals (ewe, sow, and cow). Even among the higher mammals, in a majority of the cases, the differences in metabolite concentrations were significantly different (P < 0.001) both in ovary and liver. The BaP metabolites identified were 4,5‐diol; 7,8‐diol; 9,10‐diol; 3‐hydroxy BaP; and 9‐hydroxy BaP. The rodent microsomes produced considerably higher proportion of BaP 4,5‐diol and 9,10‐diol than did cow, sow, goat, and sheep. However, microsomes from higher mammals converted a greater proportion of BaP to 3‐hydroxy and 9‐hydroxy BaP, the detoxification products of BaP. Overall, our results revealed a great variation among species to metabolize BaP. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol, 2009.",

        "abstrak":"This paper presents an experimental study on different microelectrode fabrication techniques, with particular focus on the robustness of the surface insulation towards typical working conditions required in lab-on-a-chip applications. Pt microelectrodes with diameters of 50 μm, 100 μm and 200 μm are patterned on a Si substrate with SiO(2) film. Sputtered SiO(2), low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) low-temperature oxide (LTO), Parylene C, SU-8, and dry-film were deposited and patterned on top of the chips as the passivation layer. This paper provides the detailed fabrication processes, the adhesion enhancement strategies, and the major advantages and disadvantages of each fabrication technique. Firstly, the quality and adhesion strength of the passivations were investigated by means of hydrolysis tests, in which sputtered SiO(2) and dry-film resist showed serious delamination issues and LTO showed minor defects. Secondly, the reliability of the microelectrodes was tested by impedance measurements after overnight ethanol incubation and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) formation. Thirty chips, representing a total of 300 electrodes, were measured, and statistical analyses of the results were conducted for each passivation technique. All of the electrodes passivated with these five techniques showed consistent impedance values after ethanol incubation. On the other hand, only LTO, Parylene C, and SU-8 ensured uniform electrical behavior after SAM formation. Having used both hydrolysis and impedance tests to verify the superior quality of the Parylene-based passivation, electrochemical experiments were performed to study the long-term stability of the passivation layer. Finally, the electrodes were incubated with electroactive alkanethiols functionalized with ferrocene. Square-wave voltammetry measurements demonstrated reproducible results on electrochemical label detection, which confirms the suitability of the Parylene passivation for charge-transfer-based measurements.",

        "abstrak":"To evaluate the effectiveness of a germin-like protein (GLP) in legumes against the serious soil-borne pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lentis, an Oryza sativa root-expressed GLP (OsRGLP1) was expressed in the model legume Medicago truncatula using the recombinant vector pCOsRGLP1. The transgene was highly expressed in M. truncatula transformed lines as assessed by RT-qPCR. Consistent with the active status of the transgene there was an elevated accumulation of H2O2 in transformed progeny. Enzymatic characterization of T1 transgenic progeny showed increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The additional SOD activity in transgenic lines was insensitive to potassium cyanide and sensitive to H2O2 indicating its resemblance to FeSOD. The effectiveness of the OsRGLP1 gene was tested by monitoring the root disease after infection of wild-type and transgenic lines. Wild-type plants were greatly affected by the pathogen infection showing a percent disease index value of 50 compared to 10–18 for the transgenic lines. The tolerance of the transgenic lines leads to recovery in fresh weight and pod production to an almost normal level. Analysis of defense-related genes downstream of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in transgenic plants showed induction of salicylic acid and jasmonate signaling pathways and increased expression of some pathogenesis-related-1 (PR-1) genes and a plant defensin gene. Overall, the findings suggest that OsRGLP1 provides protection against the fungal pathogen F. oxysporum that may involve the direct influence of H2O2 on signaling pathways leading to the activation of defense-related genes.",

This problem is less of an issue when low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) are deployed homogeneously but with the industrial kickoff and large scale deployments, the interoperability of heterogeneous, standards-compliant implementations will become a significant issue. To address this, we suggest two major changes to IETF RPL (RFC 6550). First we suggest that all storing mode nodes should hold the capability to understand and attach source routing headers that the non-storing mode nodes require to forward packets. Next, we suggest that RPL's non-storing mode nodes should send their destination advertisement messages hop-by-hop, rather than the current end-to-end approach. We show, with two different IPv6 implementations in TinyOS and NanoQplus, that our suggestions high achieve high interoperability performance among different implementations for downwards traffic patterns.",

Numerous drugs that cause agranulocytosis are metabolized to reactive species by neutrophils that, in turn, covalently bind to the cells; a process hypothesized to be dependent on neutrophil myeloperoxidase. However, despite extensive in vitro studies, in vivo evidence to support this is lacking. Therefore, the first goal of these studies was to characterize the involvement of myeloperoxidase in the covalent binding of amodiaquine and clozapine to neutrophils. In myeloperoxidase knockout mice treated with amodiaquine, covalent binding to neutrophils was found to decrease 2-fold compared to control. Interestingly, lack of the enzyme did not completely abolish binding, and lymphocytes were also found to extensively bind the drug. These studies confirm that myeloperoxidase is responsible for some of the covalent binding to neutrophils, but that other pathways not yet defined in neutrophils, as well as other cells, are also capable of oxidizing amodiaquine.

In this work, metabolite profiling was performed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry to identify and quantify animal fat (lard) adulteration in vegetable oil (olive oil). Principal component analysis could correctly identify and clustering olive oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, lard, and adulterated samples through the changes in their fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) profile. A targeted metabolomics method was then optimized and validated through construction of calibration curves of known FAMSs in olive oil and lard. The method was presented high linearity (R2 > 0.96) and good intra and inter day accuracy and precision (79–101 and 86–102% and 2–7 and 3–7, respectively) for determination of FAMEs. Afterwards the absolute concentration and relative percentage of FAMEs were successfully determined in 12 commercial olive oils and 3 lards samples. Methyl myristate, methyl palmitate, methyl oleate, and methyl stearate were selected as discriminant markers to identify and quantify lard adulteration even at a low level of lard (5%w\/w), with errors less than 2% in the comparison of the absolute or relative concentrations of FAMEs using several statistical methods. The proposed methodology allowed us to quantify the FAMEs simultaneously and also could predict small amount of lard in the adulterated olive oil samples.",

        "abstrak":"Purpose Arrhythmias can be treated by ablating the heart tissue in the regions of abnormal contraction. The current clinical standard provides electroanatomic 3‐D maps to visualize the electrical activation and locate the arrhythmogenic sources. However, the procedure is time‐consuming and invasive. Electromechanical wave imaging is an ultrasound‐based noninvasive technique that can provide 2‐D maps of the electromechanical activation of the heart. In order to fully visualize the complex 3‐D pattern of activation, several 2‐D views are acquired and processed separately. They are then manually registered with a 3‐D rendering software to generate a pseudo‐3‐D map. However, this last step is operator‐dependent and time‐consuming. Methods This paper presents a method to generate a full 3‐D map of the electromechanical activation using multiple 2‐D images. Two canine models were considered to illustrate the method: one in normal sinus rhythm and one paced from the lateral region of the heart. Four standard echographic views of each canine heart were acquired. Electromechanical wave imaging was applied to generate four 2‐D activation maps of the left ventricle. The radial positions and activation timings of the walls were automatically extracted from those maps. In each slice, from apex to base, these values were interpolated around the circumference to generate a full 3‐D map. Results In both cases, a 3‐D activation map and a cine‐loop of the propagation of the electromechanical wave were automatically generated. The 3‐D map showing the electromechanical activation timings overlaid on realistic anatomy assists with the visualization of the sources of earlier activation (which are potential arrhythmogenic sources). The earliest sources of activation corresponded to the expected ones: septum for the normal rhythm and lateral for the pacing case. Conclusions The proposed technique provides, automatically, a 3‐D electromechanical activation map with a realistic anatomy. This represents a step towards a noninvasive tool to efficiently localize arrhythmias in 3‐D.",

Both parts of the ganglion lacked the 220 kDa subunit of axoplasmic neurofilaments (NFs). However, they did contain a protein of about 190 kDa that reacted with the Pruss anti‐inter‐mediate filament antibody (aIFA; Pruss et al.: Cell 27:419–428, 1981), but not with a phosphorylationdependent NF antibody (Cohen et al.: I Neurosci 7: 2056–2074, 1987). Dephosphorylation of the axoplasmic NF 220 Vielded a product that comigrated on twodimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis with the 190 kDa ganglion protein, suggesting that the latter represented the incompletely phosphorylated precursor of NF220. The major low molecular weight aIFA‐reactive species in the ganglion preparation was a polypeptide of about 65kDa. A relatively small quantity of that polypeptide was also found in axoplasm and it comigrated in 2D gels with an aIFA‐reactive polypeptide from the glial sheath. These results indicate that the site of modification of the 190 kDa NF precursor to the 220 kDa axonal form is probably at the point where the axon initial segments leave the ganglion, which is several mm distal to its site of synthesis in the cell body. Furthermore, the filament network of the axoplasm and possibly the cell bodies includes a gliallike intermediate filament protein in addition to the NF protein subunits.",

        "abstrak":"Infrared spectra obtained from the Mariner 9 spacecraft during the 1971–1972 dust storm are used to derive information on the composition and particle size distribution of the dust and to study the time evolution of the storm. The dust is not composed of pure granite, basalt, basaltic glass, obsidian, quartz, andesite, or montmorillonite. The infrared spectra suggest that the dust is a mixture of materials, dominated by igneous silicates with >62;60% SiO2, or weathering products such as clay minerals, but the dust could possibly have a significant component of lower SiO2 materials such as basalt. Substantial quantities of carbonates, nitrates, or carbon suboxide are excluded from the mixture. All infrared, visible, and ultraviolet data on the Martian surface composition seem consistent with a mixture of basalt and clay minerals or high SiO2 igneous rocks, with a surface patina of oxides of iron. For all candidate compositions, the data are best matched with a size distribution that approximates a differential power law function of slope −4. This size distribution is quite similar to terrestial size distributions in regions remote from sources of dust. The relative abundance of particles between 1- and 10-μm radius did not change during the Mariner 9 mission; thus suspended particles did not experience Stokes-Cunningham fallout but instead were supported by turbulence with an eddy diffusion coefficient, Ke ⋍ 7 × 106 cm2sec−1.

Identifying patients' risk of developing a primary nosocomial CDI is a critical first step in reducing the development of new cases of CDI. OBJECTIVE To derive a clinical prediction rule that can predict a patient's risk of acquiring a primary CDI. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Large tertiary healthcare center. PATIENTS Total of 61,482 subjects aged at least 18 admitted over a 1-year period (2013). INTERVENTION None. METHODS Patient demographic characteristics, evidence of CDI, and other risk factors were retrospectively collected. To derive the CDI clinical prediction rule the patient population was divided into a derivation and validation cohort. A multivariable analysis was performed in the derivation cohort to identify risk factors individually associated with nosocomial CDI and was validated on the validation sample. RESULTS Among 61,482 subjects, CDI occurred in 0.46%. CDI outcome was significantly associated with age, admission in the past 60 days, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, history of congestive heart failure, and use of antibiotic medications. The sensitivity and specificity of the score, in the validation set, were 82.0% and 75.7%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.85. CONCLUSION This study successfully derived a clinical prediction rule that will help identify patients at high risk for primary CDI. This tool will allow physicians to systematically recognize those at risk for CDI and will allow for early interventional strategies. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;37:896-900.",

Under the condition of similitude law, the seismic responses of model slopes are investigated with different input wave kinds, frequencies, excitation directions and amplitudes. Taking the situations of inputting acceleration amplitude of 0.3g as the typical example, the co-rotating acceleration dynamic responses of model slope with different lithology associations are analyzed under the single crude seismic load. The results show that the responses present obvious non-linearity along vertical and horizontal directions; and the elevation has amplification effect on seismic waves totally. Under the horizontal seismic load, the dynamic responses of slope appears mainly at the middle-upper part. However, with the equal input seismic load, the largest amplification of vertical acceleration is only one half of that of the horizontal acceleration; and the dynamic responses of slope appears mainly at the middle-lower part. The effects of different lithology associations on the acceleration response rules also vary with the different excitation directions. That is, under the horizontal seismic load, the hardness-upward slope demonstrates larger amplification effect of acceleration than the softness-upward slope basically; and under the vertical load, the result is opposite. Finally, by comparison of acceleration Fourier spectra in different elevations on the slope surface, the hardness-upward slope has obvious selectivity of predominant frequencies while the waves are propagating from the bottom; and for both model slopes, the predominant frequencies in vertical excitation concentrate on higher frequency ranges than those in horizontal excitation.",

Many challenges were overcome quickly during the first 48 h, including installation and operation of Aerial Measuring System equipment on multiple USFJ aircraft, flying over difficult terrain, and flying with USFJ pilots who were unfamiliar with the Aerial Measuring System flight patterns. These factors combined to make for a programmatically unanticipated situation. In addition to the challenges of multiple and ongoing releases, integration with the Japanese government to provide valid aerial radiological survey products that both military and civilian customers could use to make informed decisions was extremely complicated.

It reviews the prevalence, role of the pediatrician in differentiating anxiety disorders from age-appropriate fears or normative responses to stressors, use of assessment tools, evidence-based treatment, and provides psychoeducation resources for children, parents, and clinicians. It reviews considerations for treatment modality and evidence for use of cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychopharmacology.Recent findingsFirst-line treatment of mild severity anxiety disorders is guided by well-established evidence and supported by randomized controlled trials that includes psychoeducation and psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). When anxiety is moderate to severe in intensity or impairment, initiation of psychopharmacology is considered in combination with CBT. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have the most evidence in randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials and are recommended as first line for anxiety disorders, starting with low doses. It is important to discuss and monitor for potential adverse effects. Complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies are often used by youth, though there is limited evidence for benefit in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders, and potential risks need to be considered.SummaryPediatric anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents and can result in significant impairment and morbidity. Pediatricians have an important role in identifying and facilitating treatment for youth with anxiety disorders, and CBT and psychopharmacology, particularly SSRIs, have the most evidence. However, accessing CBT for many families remains challenging. Pediatricians can provide psychoeducation and resources as a first step and initiate medications if indicated. Further research into integration of mental healthcare in pediatric settings could increase access to CBT and decrease morbidity. In addition, more randomized controlled trials and comparison studies for medications, CAM therapies, and combination treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders are needed.",

Among the null-subject languages which do not allow a null subject in this context are Chinese (various dialects), Finnish and European Portuguese. Among the languages that allow it are Japanese, Persian, and Spanish. An explanation is proposed of this variation, based on the following correlation: The languages which do not allow a null subject standardly reply to yes\/no-questions by repeating the finite verb of the question. The languages which allow a null subject standardly reply by using a special affirmation particle ‘yes’. The connection between these two properties is that both involve polarity focus. The proposal is that a null subject in the second conjunct is prohibited in the former class because of a competition of derivations involving ellipsis. This hypothesis is based on the theory of polarity focus in Finnish articulated in Holmberg (2001).",

The enantioseparation was performed under normal and reversed polarity modes and reversed enantiomer migration order was achieved under two modes. The parameters affecting the chiral separation, such as buffer pH, DxS concentration, organic additive, and temperature were investigated and optimized. Reversed polarity mode provided better separation for the two drugs. The optimized conditions for the enantioseparation under reversed polarity mode were 2.0% (w\/v) DxS, 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2.5 with an applied voltage of −30 kV at 25 °C. Direct UV detection was performed at 200 nm. Under the optimal conditions, rotigotine and THP enantiomers were enantioresolved in 40 min with the resolution of 2.0 and 5.8, respectively.

        "abstrak":"Hemodynamic perturbation during hepatic graft reperfusion in patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) is challenging and is frequently accompanied by bradyarrhythmia and even asystole. However, detailed data on electrocardiographic (ECG) changes during reperfusion are almost nonexistent, although the correct diagnosis by record is important for the treatment. We aimed to identify ECG rhythm disturbances during graft reperfusion and to investigate risk factors and outcomes. Data from 1065 consecutive patients who underwent adult LT were analyzed. The incidence, type, and detailed characteristics of ECG changes immediately after graft reperfusion were assessed using an electronically archived intraoperative ECG database. We analyzed risk factors, postoperative outcomes including major cardiovascular events, 30‐day and 1‐year mortalities of recipients based on the occurrence of atrioventricular (AV) block, and asystole during reperfusion. The typical pattern of postreperfusion bradyarrhythmia was progressive PR interval prolongation until a Mobitz type 1 AV block occurred. The overall incidence of AV block was 5.0% (53\/1065), and 30.2% of them (16\/53) had initiated as AV block and then progressed into ventricular asystole. Fulminant hepatic failure was a significant predictor for occurrence of AV block (odds ratio [OR], 7.20; 95% confidence interval, 3.38‐15.32; P < 0.001). Patients with AV block showed significantly higher incidence of postoperative major cardiovascular events (P < 0.001) and 30‐day mortality (P = 0.002) than those without AV block, whereas the 1‐year mortality was not different between the 2 groups (P = 0.10). The postreperfusion asystole was consistently preceded by a Mobitz type 1 AV block. The occurrence of AV block and asystole appears to be an important prognosticator. Therefore, maintaining an optimal range of physiological status and gradual unclamping of the vena cava to avoid sudden atrial distension are recommended in high‐risk patients during reperfusion period.

Yet, neither the exquisite tactile human sensibility, nor the intricate anatomy or the muscles actuating the hand and the wrist can explain the manipulation skills of normal humans. Fine manipulation tasks are possible thanks to automatic control processes that manage the flow of sensory information and correlate it to the right motor commands. Currently, a state-of–the-art artificial hand can be compared to an almost totally anesthetized human hand. Such poor sensorization makes even the simplest manipulation task difficult to control. \nThis PhD Thesis presents a novel bio-inspired approach to the design of artificial hands with a smart sensory system already embedded. The development of an advanced humanoid hand with a high number of DoFs is useless without the design of an adequate and reliable set of proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. Furthermore, another milestone in this integrated design strategy is the awareness that the output signals of all sensors have to be complementary. The result of their fusion into the control architecture has been considered in advance to develop a smart and effective local low level control for grasping and dextrous manipulation of objects. \nIn this work, the novel artificial hands and sensors developed are presented, together with original integrated low-level control modules for grasping and detecting softness and roughness of objects.",

        "abstrak":"Chromosomal microarray testing is commonly used to identify disease causing de novo copy number variants in patients with developmental delay and multiple congenital anomalies. In such a patient we now observed an 150 kb deletion on chromosome 7q21.11 affecting the first exon of the axon guidance molecule gene SEMA3A (sema domain, immunoglobulin domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin) 3A). This deletion was inherited from the healthy father, but considering the function of SEMA3A and phenotypic similarity to the knock‐out mice, we still assumed a pathogenic relevance and tested for a recessive second defect. Sequencing of SEMA3A in the patient indeed revealed the de novo in‐frame mutation p.Phe316_Lys317delinsThrSerSerAsnGlu. Cloning of the mutated allele in combination with two informative SNPs confirmed compound heterozygosity in the patient. While the altered protein structure was predicted to be benign, aberrant splicing resulting in a premature stop codon was proven by RT‐PCR to occur in about half of the transcripts from this allele. Expression profiling in human fetal and adult cDNA panels, confirmed a high expression of SEMA3A in all brain regions as well as in adult and fetal heart and fetal skeletal muscle. Normal intellectual development in the patient was surprising but may be explained by the remaining 20% of SEMA3A expression level demonstrated by quantitative RT‐PCR. We therefore report a novel autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by postnatal short stature with relative macrocephaly, camptodactyly, septal heart defect and several minor anomalies caused by biallelic mutations in SEMA3A. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The present phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study was conducted to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of multiple-dose monotherapy of the FLT3 inhibitor, quizartinib, in Japanese patients with R\/R AML. Patients received oral quizartinib, once daily, under fasting conditions in 28-day cycles. Sixteen patients (median age, 68.0 years; male, 56.3%; FLT3-ITD positive, 43.8%) received quizartinib (9, 3, and 4 patients at 20, 30, and 60 mg\/day, respectively; median treatment duration, 95.0 days; median relative dose intensity, 100.0%). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were electrocardiogram QT prolonged (43.8%, grade 1 or 2) followed by nausea and pyrexia (37.5% each). No quizartinib-related deaths were reported. A dose-dependent increase of quizartinib and its active metabolite AC886 levels was observed at the steady state. The composite complete remission rate was 37.5%. Quizartinib was well tolerated in Japanese R\/R AML patients at doses up to 60 mg\/day; quizartinib 60 mg\/day was considered as the recommended dose for the Japanese patient population in a subsequent study.

They have also been shown to be carcinogenic in animals. As an alkylating agent, DMS is a typical SN2 agent, attacking predominantly nitrogen sites in nucleic acids. DES is capable of SN1 alkylations as well as SN2 and thereby causes some alkylation on oxygen sites including the O6-position of guanine which is thought to be significant in mutagenesis by direct mispairing. The mutagenicity of DMS is better explained in terms of indirect, repair-dependent processes. With respect to both alkylating activity and genetic effects, striking similarities are found between DMS and MMS and between DES and EMS. In most systems where they have been tested, both DMS and DES are mutagenic. Results of many of the mutagenesis studies involving these compounds and other alkylating sulfuric acid esters are summarized in Tables 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this review. Most data are consistent with these agents acting primarily as base-pair substitution mutagens. In the case of DES, strong specificity for G.C to A.T transitions has been reported in some systems but has not been clearly supported in some others. Low levels of frameshift mutations of the deletion type are also likely. In addition to the induction of mutations, recombinogenic and clastogenic effects have been described.",

After 1 month, the struts of the stents were fully encapsulated with membranous connective tissues formed around the silicone rods.

These tissues were composed mainly of collagen and fibroblasts and had a thickness of less than approximately 200 µm with an excellent high burst strength of approximately 1000 mmHg. The luminal surface of the tissues was extremely flat and smooth.

Final diagnosis of infection was established in 32 of 63 patients and in 23 of 32 by microbiology.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSensitivity of (99m)Tc-HMPAO-WBC single-photon emission computed tomography\/computed tomography (SPECT\/CT) was 94% for both detection and localization of CIED-associated infection. SPECT\/CT imaging had a definite added diagnostic value over both planar and stand-alone SPECT. Pocket infection was often associated with lead(s) involvement; the intracardiac portion of the lead(s) more frequently exhibited (99m)Tc-HMPAO-WBC accumulation and presented the highest rate of complications, infectious endocarditis, and septic embolism. Two false negative cases and no false positive results were observed. None of the patients with negative (99m)Tc-HMPAO-WBC scintigraphy developed CIED-related infection during follow-up of 12 months. Echography of the cardiac region\/venous pathway of the device had 90% specificity, but low sensitivity (81% when intracardiac lead[s] infection only was considered). The Duke criteria had 31% sensitivity for the definite category (100% specificity) and 81% for the definite and possible categories (77% specificity).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n(99m)Tc-HMPAO-WBC scintigraphy enabled the confirmation of the presence of CIED-associated infection, definition of the extent of device involvement, and detection of associated complications. Moreover, (99m)Tc-HMPAO-WBC scintigraphy reliably excluded device-associated infection during a febrile episode and sepsis, with 95% negative predictive value.",

The sternal malformation\/vascular dysplasia association consists of sternal clefts with hemangiomas of the skin and internal organs. Abnormalities of the sternum have also been described in the PHACES syndrome which consists of posterior fossa malformations, hemangiomas, arterial anomalies, cardiac defects, and eye abnormalities. Case: We report a case and associated images of an infant prenatally diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm and chest wall deformity. Postnatally, echocardiogram and MRI revealed a large aneurysm of the proximal descending aorta measuring 1.1 × 1.8 cm. The aneurysm began just distal to the origin of the left carotid artery, and a moderate pre-aneurysmal coarctation was noted. The origin of the left subclavian artery was distal to the aneurysm. In addition, partial sternal cleft with agenesis of the manubrium was noted. The intracranial anatomy was normal, and U\/S and MRI revealed no hemangiomas of the head and neck vessels. Dermatologic evaluation revealed no evidence of cutaneous hemangiomas. Bronchoscopy revealed no hemangiomas of the respiratory tract. Ophthalmologic exam revealed normal ocular anatomy. Conclusion: Hemangiomas are the hallmark of both the sternal malformation\/vascular dysplasia association and PHACES syndrome. We have, however, identified a case of sternal cleft with aortic aneurysm in the absence of cutaneous or visceral hemangiomas. Although these malformations may be unrelated, this case may also represent a variant of the PHACES syndrome.",

The article addresses both aspects of the phenomenon: Why did Western states privatize military tasks, and why did they do so to varying extents? The neorealist argument of the market providing a competitive edge for the armed forces and liberalist ‘casualty aversion’ and ‘cost-effectiveness’ explanation both equally fail to provide a comprehensive answer for the privatization of military tasks. Alternatively, the article employs sociological institutionalism, arguing that transnational norms on conventional warfare prescribe the structure and organization of armed forces. If the content of these norms changes, states will adjust their force structure accordingly. Consequentially, states started to privatize military tasks when the requirements changed from self-sufficiency to more market reliance. However, transnational norms have to work their way through domestic norms resulting in variations. The more consistent transnational normative demands are with the domestic structure, the more extensive the former demands are implemented. The crucial domestic variable is the notion of sovereignty. If sovereignty is defined minimally market solutions are embraced and military activities are outsourced extensively. If states hold a broader understanding of sovereignty, they are reluctant to hand over military tasks to the market.",

This work will present a hybrid approach to sensor array interrogation, where both power and data interrogation commands are conveyed via an autonomous aerial vehicle that is sent (via remote piloting or GPS autopilot programming) to each sensor or node to perform the individual interrogation. Power does not have to reside at the sensor node, relaxing battery or other such powering requirements.

Furthermore, the outcome of transplantation in the elderly is comparable to younger patients in terms of allograft survival. The exact nature of this phenomenon is not completely clear. As the elderly population continues to grow, it becomes more important to identify specific issues associated with kidney transplantation. In particular, elderly transplant recipients might have a lower chance of acute rejection as their immune systems seem to be less reactive. This might predispose elderly recipients to greater risk of post‐transplant infectious complications or malignancies. Furthermore, due to differences in pharmacokinetics, elderly recipients might require lower doses of immunosuppressive medication. As the main cause of graft failure in the elderly is death with a functioning graft and also considering the scarcity of donor organs, it might make sense to recommend transplanting elderly recipients with extended criteria donor kidneys. This approach would balance shorter patient survival compared to younger recipients. In conclusion, old age should not preclude ESRD patients from kidney transplantation.

We aimed to establish and validate a new prognostic scoring system, named ALPH-Q, that integrates electrocardiography parameters that may be used to predict short-term mortality of patients with ACHBLF. Two hundred fourteen patients were included in this study. The APLH-Q score was constructed by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and was validated in an independent patient cohort. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to compare the performance of different models, including APLH-Q, Child–Pugh score (CPS), model of end-stage liver disease (MELD), and a previously reported logistic regression model (LRM). The APLH-Q score was constructed with 5 independent risk factors, including age (HR = 1.034, 95% CI: 1.007–1.061), liver cirrhosis (HR = 2.753, 95% CI: 1.366–5.548), prothrombin time (HR = 1.031, 95% CI: 1.002–1.062), hepatic encephalopathy (HR = 2.703, 95% CI: 1.630–4.480), and QTc (HR = 1.008, 95% CI: 1.001–1.016). The performance of the ALPH-Q score was significantly better than that of MELD and CPS in both the training (0.896 vs 0.712, 0.896 vs 0.738, respectively, both P < 0.05) and validation cohorts (0.837 vs 0.689, 0.837 vs 0.585, respectively, both P < 0.05).

The purpose of this study was to investigate how intraoperative AP or rotational laxities measured by the navigation system could correlate with postoperative AP and rotational laxities of the patients.Methods125 patients who underwent primary isolated anatomical single- or double-bundle ACL reconstruction or augmentation using multistranded autologous hamstring tendons were included in the study after a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Clinically, absolute value and side-to-side difference (SSD) of AP translation of the tibia were measured by KT-2000 preoperatively and postoperatively. Intraoperative measurement of AP translation of the tibia and total range of tibial rotation of the ACL-injured knee were carried out using the computer-assisted navigation system. We have investigated the relationship between intraoperative measurements using the navigation system and AP laxity measurements using the KT-2000 knee arthrometer as well as rotational laxity measurements using the manual pivot shift test.ResultsThere was a positive correlation between the SSD of preoperative AP translation of the tibia measured by KT-2000 arthrometer and the reduction in AP laxity following ACL reconstruction measured by the navigation system. However, we found no significant correlation between the reduction in AP laxity measured by the navigation system and the SSD of AP translation of the tibia measured by the KT-2000 arthrometer at final follow-up. Postoperatively, eight patients had a positive pivot shift test. Using the navigation system pre- and post-ACL reconstruction, these patients could not be identified by high absolute values for AP laxity nor rotational laxity.ConclusionAlthough AP and rotational laxities vary largely among the patients, and AP and rotational stabilization are successfully achieved immediately after ACL reconstruction, intraoperative AP and rotational laxity measured by the navigation system did not influence the postoperative AP and rotational laxities after ACL reconstruction.Level of evidenceIII.",

In 2007, human vibriosis (non-cholera Vibrio infections) became a notifiable disease in the United States. In addition, Vibrio species are among the 31 major known pathogens transmitted through food in the United States. Diverse surveillance systems for foodborne pathogens also track outbreaks, illnesses, hospitalization and deaths due to non-cholera vibrios. Considering the recognition of vibriosis as a notifiable disease in the United States and the availability of diverse surveillance systems, there is a need for the development of easily deployed visualization and analysis approaches that can combine diverse data sources in an interactive manner. Current efforts to address this need are still limited. Visual analytics is an iterative process conducted via visual interfaces that involves collecting information, data preprocessing, knowledge representation, interaction, and decision making. We have utilized public domain outbreak and surveillance data sources covering 1973 to 2010, as well as visual analytics software to demonstrate integrated and interactive visualizations of data on foodborne outbreaks and surveillance of Vibrio species. Through the data visualization, we were able to identify unique patterns and\/or novel relationships within and across datasets regarding (i) causative agent; (ii) foodborne outbreaks and illness per state; (iii) location of infection; (iv) vehicle (food) of infection; (v) anatomical site of isolation of Vibrio species; (vi) patients and complications of vibriosis; (vii) incidence of laboratory-confirmed vibriosis and V. parahaemolyticus outbreaks.

We resolve this inconsistency by demonstrating that the kinetics violate detailed balance condition and drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state. By implementing diffusion kinetics that drives the system to equilibrium, even within this constrained ensemble, we recover earlier results showing phase segregation only for rods of length greater than or equal to seven. Furthermore, in contrast to the nonequilibrium steady state, the interface has no preferred orientational direction. In addition, by implementing different nonequilibrium kinetics, we show that the interface between the phase segregated states can lie in different directions depending on the choice of kinetics.",

Methods The descriptions of functional limitations were retrospectively identified for 32 patients. The original vocational rehabilitation evaluation was conducted by a multi-professional team in an out-patient clinic of a university hospital. The obtained descriptions were converted to ICF codes, the most frequent being compared with the ICF Checklist of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the ICF Comprehensive and Brief Core Sets suggested by the ICF Research Branch. Results In the study population (53 % women), 141 ICF codes were identified with a preciseness of three or more digits, the average being 21 codes\/subject (median 20.0, range 9–40). When truncated to three digits, 84 ICF codes remained (average 18 codes\/subject, range 9–25), 45 of which appeared in over 10 % of the study population, 24 also being found in the ICF Comprehensive, 5 in the ICF Brief Core Sets, and 33 in the WHO ICF Checklist. Conclusions The list of most frequent ICF codes retrospectively obtained in this study from unstandardised records showed a similarity with ICF Comprehensive and Brief Core Sets by ICF Research Branch and the ICF Checklist by WHO, but with a bias towards the identification of body structures and functions. The results support the use of ICF in vocational rehabilitation evaluation to ensure comprehensiveness of evaluation.

Ecdysteroid levels increase significantly as adult females mature and synthesis is associated with the maturation of successive waves of terminal oocytes. Although ecdysteroids are found in all body compartments, the largest amounts are associated with the maturing ovary, where ecdysone 22-fatty acyl esters predominate. These are recovered in the deposited eggs, together with a much smaller amount of ecdysone. During embryogenesis, the major free ecdysteroid changes from ecdysone to 20-hydroxyecdysone. Initially, there does not appear to be extensive metabolic turnover of the ecdysone 22-fatty acyl esters, but during the second half of embryogenesis the amount of ecdysone 22-fatty acyl esters per egg doubles and significant amounts of a new class of ecdysteroid conjugate are formed.

Pre-operational CNAV broadcast is made available to support development of L2C signal processing capability in modernized GPS receivers. The transmission of synchronized L1 C\/A and L2C codes by Block IIR-M and follow-on generations of GPS satellites allows GPS receiver designers to develop correlators for combined acquisition of the two signals to achieve additional detection sensitivity when compared to processing an individual signal. One of the key challenges in this joint acquisition is the processing complexity or cost of Doppler search to be conducted over the synchronized data-bit intervals of 20 milliseconds in each of the L1 and L2C channels. To date, researchers have addressed this problem by limiting the coherent correlation interval to a 1ms period, thereby reducing the Doppler search space while combining the outcomes of 20 coherent correlations through non-coherent and differentially-coherent processing techniques to compensate the effect of residual Doppler appearing across the data-bit interval in each of the L1 and L2C channels. These solutions however compromise the signal-tonoise- ratio when compared to fully coherent processing of signals over 20 milliseconds. In this paper, we propose complex-averaging of L1 and L2C signals at the IF stage to reduce the sampling rate of the Doppler signal, and accomplish the Doppler search at a low processing cost without compromising the detection performance of individual channels. The scheme is evaluated theoretically as well as validated through experiments on real GPS signals broadcast by Block IIR-M satellites. The proposed processing approach allows GPS receivers to detect weaker signals through low-power processors.",

        "abstrak":"The role of a power transformer protective relay is to rapidly operate the tripping during fault condition and block the tripping during other operating conditions of the power transformer. This paper presents a new approach for classifying transient phenomena in power transformers, which may be implemented in digital relaying for transformer differential protection. Discrimination among different operating conditions (normal, inrush, over excitation, CT saturation and internal fault) of the power transformer is achieved by combining wavelet transform with neural network. The wavelet transform is applied for the analysis of power transformer transient phenomena, because of its ability to extract information from the transient signal simultaneously in both time and frequency domain. Neural network is used because of its self-learning and highly nonlinear mapping capability. The proposed scheme has been realized through two different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (one is used as an internal fault detector (IFD) and another one is used as a condition monitor (CM)). These two ANN architectures were trained using BPN (back propagation algorithm) alone, and combining BPN with wavelet transforms (WNN), so that it should recognize and classify all the above operating conditions and faults. The simulation results obtained shows that the new algorithm accurately provides high operating sensitivity for internal faults and remains stable for other operating conditions of the power transformer. From that it was inferred that the combined WNN provides more accurate results and it has high-speed response and increased ability to discriminate even low-level fault signals from other operating conditions",

The understanding of the corresponding mechanistic details is still far from complete even on the conceptual level. Here, the author proposes a generic kinetic model describing a global interplay between the function of membrane ion channels and gene expression, including gene transcription into mRNA and mRNA translation into protein. The model, based partly on the Hindmarsh–Rose neuron model for membrane voltage, implies feedbacks between these processes. Specifically, the gene transcription is considered to depend on membrane voltage due to the corresponding dependence of one of the transcription factors. The number or efficiency of function of ion channels is in turn assumed to depend on the protein population. With these feedbacks, the model predicts either a single steady state or bistability. The bistable regimes are briefly discussed in the context of long-term memory.",

We report a novel stimulatory effect of glycine-extended gastrin17 only on cell\/cell dissociation and cell migration in a non-tumorigenic mouse gastric epithelial cell line (IMGE-5). In contrast, both amidated and glycine-extended gastrin17 stimulated proliferation of IMGE-5 cells via distinct receptors. Glycine-extended gastrin17-induced dissociation preceded migration and was blocked by selective inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) but did not require mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Furthermore, glycine-extended gastrin17 induced a PI3-kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the adherens junction protein β-catenin, partial dissociation of the complex between β-catenin and the transmembrane protein E-cadherin, and delocalization of β-catenin into the cytoplasm. Long lasting activation of MAP kinases by glycine-extended gastrin17 was specifically required for the migratory response, in contrast to the involvement of a rapid and transient MAP kinase activation in the proliferative response to both amidated and glycine-extended gastrin17. Therefore, the time course of MAP kinase activation appears to be a critical determinant of the biological effects mediated by this pathway. Together with the involvement of PI3-kinase in the dissociation of adherens junctions, long term activation of MAP kinases seems responsible for the selectivity of this novel effect of G17-Gly on the adhesion and migration of gastric epithelial cells.",

Hirano bodies were observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of homozygous double transgenic 6 month old mice containing Cre. The Hirano bodies were eosinophilic rods, and also exhibited the paracrystalline F-actin filament organization that is characteristic of these inclusions. Mice with Hirano bodies appear healthy and fertile, but exhibited some alterations in both short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, including paired-pulse depression rather than facilitation, and decreased magnitude of early LTP.ConclusionsHirano bodies are not lethal and appear to have little or no effect on histology and tissue organization. Hirano bodies do modulate synaptic plasticity and exert clearly discernable effects on LTP and paired-pulse paradigms.

We hypothesized that the supplementation of amino acids before and during an ultra-marathon would lead to a reduction in the variables of skeletal muscle damage, a decrease in muscle soreness and an improved performance.MethodsTwenty-eight experienced male ultra-runners were divided into two groups, one with amino acid supplementation and the other as a control group. The amino acid group was supplemented a total of 52.5 g of an amino acid concentrate before and during the 100 km ultra-marathon. Pre- and post-race, creatine kinase, urea and myoglobin were determined. At the same time, the athletes were asked for subjective feelings of muscle soreness.ResultsRace time was not different between the groups when controlled for personal best time in a 100 km ultra-marathon. The increases in creatine kinase, urea and myoglobin were not different in both groups. Subjective feelings of skeletal muscle soreness were not different between the groups.ConclusionsWe concluded that short-term supplementation of amino acids before and during a 100 km ultra-marathon had no effect on variables of skeletal muscle damage and muscle soreness.",

These cells lie amongst supporting cells that probably secrete the cupula, which is composed of polysaccharide and proteins as is the test. Ciona is sensitive to near-field vibrations, even after the brain has been removed; the significance of this observation and of the arrangement of the cupular organs is discussed.

        "abstrak":"In 1901 Robert S. Peabody lamented the lack of instruction in archaeology at his high school alma mater Phillips Academy, a prestigious New England boarding school. To rectify the situation, he used family funds and artifacts amassed by his personal curator Warren K. Moorehead to establish a Department of Archaeology at the school. A building was constructed and Moorehead and Peabody’s son, Charles, set about teaching classes. The pattern established by Moorehead and Peabody, however, was disrupted in 1914 when the school refocused the program exclusively on research. Classes were offered periodically over the next decades, and some students were inspired to follow their high school passions to lifetime careers in our field. Successive administrators at the institution, ultimately called the Robert S. Peabody Institute of Archaeology, struggled to find a place for archaeology in the high school curriculum due to a variety of factors. Cyclical trends in teaching archaeology at Phillips Academy and long term struggles to integrate archaeology into the high school classroom mirror nationwide patterns, providing a case study that can inform the broader initiative to harness the excitement and interdisciplinary aspect of archaeology, and to encourage stewardship of archaeological resources. The experience of the educators at Phillips Academy, however, suggests that these goals may be at odds with one another and require a delicate balancing act to achieve sustained results. ______________________________________________________________________ Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts is an independent, private boarding and day school dedicated to college preparation for high school students. This article examines the role that archaeology has played in Phillips Academy’s high school curriculum from a historical perspective and places it in a more general context of what does and does not work in terms of archaeology in the high school curriculum. Despite having its own archaeology museum founded at the outset of the twentieth century, there were long periods where archaeology and anthropology were largely absent from the Phillips Academy curriculum. This article explores these fits and starts in teaching archaeology and anthropology and looks for patterns that might align with broader trends in American education and the attempts to include archaeology in the high school classroom. I survey five periods in the intertwined histories of Phillips Academy and its archaeology program, beginning with the initial establishment of the Department of Archaeology in 1901. Between 1938 and 1968 the institution, then known as the Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeology, occasionally offered archaeology electives, but staff members primarily focused on research and leadership roles in American Archaeology. Retirements and new personnel—namely the addition of Richard “Scotty” MacNeish—reinvigorated the archaeology program in the late 1960s and saw a new episode of teaching archaeology and anthropology that abruptly ended 1 Wheeler: Archaeology in the Classroom at a New England Prep School Published by DigitalCommons@UMaine, 2019 in 1983. During the 1990s the focus was on a more traditional, public-facing museum, with exhibitions and museum-based educational programs. Most recently a new focus on using archaeology in the high school classroom with a mix of different approaches, all grounded in experiential and collaborative learning, has seen some success. Finally, I look at the contemporary and historical challenges faced at Phillips Academy and how these inform larger trends in education.",

The density plunging flow is modeled in three-dimensions through a dam reservoir with diverging and sloping bottom channels, and the plunging phenomenon has been reproduced in the present model. Nonlinear and unsteady continuity, momentum, energy and turbulence model equations are formulated in the Cartesian coordinates both in a sloping and in a diverging channel. For the turbulence viscosity, a k – e turbulence model including buoyancy effects is used to reproduce the main flow characteristics. To investigate the Coriolis force effect on the density flow in a dam reservoir, Coriolis force parameter is also included in the governing equations. The equations of the model are solved based on the initial and boundary conditions of the dam reservoir flow for a range of bottom slopes and divergence angles. In this paper the main interest is the formation of separated flows, such as wall-jet and free-jet flows. The model successfully simulates the formation of attached flow, wall jets, and free jets in a negatively buoyant environment. The simulation results obtained from this study are compared with previous experimental work, and the mathematical model studies data on density current generated by the plunging of cold water in ambient warm water in a diverging channel, and is found to be of the same magnitude as the experimental measurements and followed the expected basic trend.",

Background: Traditionally the diagnosis of heart failure has been made on the basis of presence of certain signs and symptoms .In case of chronic outpatients, where the physical signs are usually prominent, the diagnosis is easy, whereas in elderly who present to the emergency department with acute dyspnea it is sometimes challenging and often difficult particularly when associated chronic pulmonary diseases are also present. Elevated plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been demonstrated to be a powerful marker for diagnosis and discrimination of dyspnea in the setting of heart failure from a non-cardiac dyspnea. Methods: We studied 105 subjects (mean age 51.57±5.11 yr), 35 presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea due to HF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III], 35 presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea due to pulmonary causes and 35 normal controls, in Dr. HMI Institute of Pharmacology & Herbal Sciences in collaboration with Arif Medical complex Karachi From June 2004 to Dec 2004. Results: Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Their serum levels of BNP were estimated and compared. Levels of serum BNP in patients with HF were found to be significantly high as compared to the non-cardiac dyspneic patients and control subjects [680±45.20,375.21±25.63 and 78.45±16.44 respectively] Conclusion: BNP level can be a useful tool in differentiation of a heart failure patient from a non-cardiac patient presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea.",

The lifetime was obtained from the small signal photovoltage decay and by the recovery time. An agreement is generally found for the variations of L and tau , especially for the phosphorous pregettered cells, in which the values of L and tau are higher due to a decrease of intragrain defect recombination strength.

Here we show that the traditional calculation without considering the coverage rate globally overestimated the forest gross carbon dioxide uptake by approximately 8.7%, with a value of 5.12 ± 0.23 Pg C yr−1, which is equivalent to 48% of the annual emissions from anthropogenic activities in 2012. Actually, the global annual GPP of forest ecosystems is approximately 53.71 ± 4.83 Pg C yr−1 for the past 30 years by taking the coverage rate into account. Accordingly, we argue that forest annual GPP calculated by previous studies has been overestimated due to the exaggerated forest area, and therefore, coverage rate may be a required factor to further quantify the global carbon cycle.",

The second allows the interested reader to run paramaterized explosive silicon burning calculations in which the user inputs his own parameters. These tools are intended to aid in the identification of nuclear reaction rates important for experimental study.

        "tahun_terbit":2013,
        "abstrak":"Over the past 20 years, thousands of small-scale farmers in eastern Africa have seen a dramatic turnaround in their lives. Where once they battled with poverty and hunger, they are now able to feed their families and invest in the future of their farms. They no longer live on the edge of society, but have become community leaders, and their children are healthy and assured of a good education. Their success is based on adopting a revolutionary approach to farming known as ‘push–pull’, which was pioneered by Dr Zeyaur R. Khan. Dr Khan, a distinguished international pro fessional entomologist, has dedicated his 33-year career to advancing the science and practice of entomology by studying and applying chemical ecology, insect behaviour, and plant–plant and insect–plant inter actions. His aim has always been to improve agricultural productivity as a means to combat poverty and food insecurity in Africa. His work in developing push–pull is a wonderful example demonstrating that creativity and innovation in agricultural sciences can provide practical solutions for the real problems of poor smallholders by removing constraints to their farming, leading to better food security and sustainable livelihoods. Global opinion is now united in the belief that efforts to improve Africa’s agricultural productivity must be based on approaches that are more environmentally sustainable and people-centred than the technologies that fuelled the Asian Green Revolution. Push–pull fits the bill perfectly: it is a holistic approach to pest and soil management; it teaches farmers how to become food-secure and build a livelihood on just a small piece of land, without demanding seasonal inputs that are beyond their resources; in protecting and enhancing soil fertility it lays the foundation for sustainable productivity gains; and it prepares farmers for the future by giving them the knowledge and tools they need to adapt their farming systems to the challenges of climate change.",

        "tahun_terbit":2017,
        "abstrak":"Triclosan was first introduced in the early 1970s and has been used increasingly over the past 25 years. Due to its potential to act as broad spectrum antimicrobial agent, it has been used as major ingredient in disinfectants, soap, detergent, toothpaste, mouthwash, fabric, deodorant, shampoo and innumerable other personal care, veterinary, industrial and household products. The main target of triclosan’s antimicrobial action is on bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Triclosan causes cytoplasmic disorganization in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane at bactericidal concentrations. In addition to its antimicrobial and anti-plaque effect, antiinflammatory properties of triclosan have also been reported. Because of unique mechanism of action, it has been also considered a potential chemotherapeutic candidate and also as an inhibitor against infectious diseases such as tuberculosis or malaria. Over last few decades, triclosan incorporated in daily use products have been used throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Excessive use of triclosan containing personal care products are subjected to release into environment through various pathways. Triclosan was one of the most frequently detected organic pollutants in both waste water and surface water. The safety, effectiveness and regulation of its usage have become a major concern as the detection limit in the environment is increasing at a continuous rate. Though triclosan is known to be biodegradable, however it has been detected at some levels in sewage water treated samples. Past research has shown triclosan can produce toxic effects such as cytotoxic, genotoxic, and endocrine disruptor effects in aquatic organisms including algae, fishes and crustaceans. Moreover, chemical properties of triclosan suggest its possible bioaccumulation and further environmental persistence. The hydrophobic nature of triclosan has also been responsible for its accumulation in fatty tissues of human samples. For past few years, triclosan is increasingly scrutinized after it emerged as a toxic environmental contaminant. Despite its pharmacological properties, occurrence and toxicity of triclosan have become major issues. In recent years, several studies have been Abstract: Triclosan is a multipurpose compound that has been used as major ingredient in most of the household products. It is found to be effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Besides being a broadspectrum anti-microbial agent, other pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory effects have also been reported. However, continuous exposure to increasing levels of triclosan has become a major concern for both public health and environment. Several studies revealed triclosan has become an emerging contaminant which may adversely affect the aquatic animals, human, wildlife and microbial communities. The occurrence of high triclosan levels in various environmental compartments has shown to produce cytotoxic, genotoxic, and endocrine disruptor effects in living organisms of both aquatic and terrestrial environments. In this review, we document physio-chemical properties of triclosan and summarize the current findings on pharmacological benefits from its usage. Considering triclosan induced environmental and health concerns, we have highlighted detrimental effects on different biological systems and emphasize on restrained use of triclosan containing products.",

Following the accidental discovery of its potent psychoactive effects in 1943, it was supplied by Sandoz Laboratories as an experimental drug that might be useful as an adjunct for psychotherapy, or to give psychiatrists insight into the mental processes in their patients. The finding of serotonin in the mammalian brain in 1953, and its structural resemblance to LSD, quickly led to ideas that serotonin in the brain might be involved in mental disorders, initiating rapid research interest in the neurochemistry of serotonin. LSD proved to be physiologically very safe and nonaddictive, with a very low incidence of adverse events when used in controlled experiments. Widely hailed by psychiatry as a breakthrough in the 1950s and early 1960s, clinical research with LSD ended by about 1970, when it was formally placed into Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 following its growing popularity as a recreational drug. Within the past 5 years, clinical research with LSD has begun in Europe, but there has been none in the United States. LSD is proving to be a powerful tool to help understand brain dynamics when combined with modern brain imaging methods. It remains to be seen whether therapeutic value for LSD can be confirmed in controlled clinical trials, but promising results have been obtained in small pilot trials of depression, anxiety, and addictions using psilocybin, a related psychedelic molecule.",

        "abstrak":"Sir, McBain et a1 reported an incidence of ectopic pregnancies of 3 1 % after hPG-hCG induced ovulation. This rate is higher than in the general population, and occurred in the absence of predisposing factors. Two of their six cases were combined with intrauterine pregnancy. They found an association between ectopic pregnancy and elevated urinary total oestrogens (>200 pg\/24 hours) around the time of the ovulation. On reviewing our data we could not confirm such a high incidence. In the infertility clinic of the Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer we have treated over 800 women with hMG-hCG (Pergonal) in over 3000 cycles. Three women had 4 ectopic pregnancies, a rate of I .14% (4:350 pregnancies), This rate is slightly higher than in our general population, but the incidence of ectopic pregnancy in our hospital has increased over the last 4 years from an overall rate of 0.82% (1:121 pregnancies) to 1.17% (1:85 pregnancies). This increased rate might be due to an increased rate of pelvic inflammatory disease and also to improved methods of diagnosis of the early or clinically uncertain ectopic pregnancy such as ultrasound, laparoscopy and particularly serum hCCi beta subunits. On reviewing the laparoscopies of those three women, we found that two of the three had a mechanical factor. Only in one case did the tubal pregnancy occur without any known tubal pathology. Urinary total oestrogens on the day of hCG administration in all four cases of ectopic pregnancy was between 80-160 ygj24 hours, which is the optimal range (100-200 pg\/24 hours). If high oestrogen levels are associated with ectopic pregnancy, the incidence should be higher in cycles with hyperstimulation. We have a 19.8 % hyperstimulation rate in those cycles resulting in pregnancy. This syndrome is mainly associated with high oestrogen levels. In view of the 10% ectopic pregnancy rate reported by McBain in cycles with urinary oestrogens above 200 pg\/24 hours it is expected that there would be at least 8 ectopic pregnancies in our hyperstimulated patients, but there were none. Although it has been postulated that high oestrogen levels during ovulation might accelerate tubal transport, and. low levels cause delay of tubal transport or locking, these are more likely to result in degeneration of the ovum (Burdick and Pincus, 1935) rather than ectopic pregnancy. We feel therefore that McBain’s results, although interesting, are not supported by our data.",

The genes of this ZFX\/ZFY family appear to encode proteins comprising an amino-terminal acidic domain, a putative nuclear localizing signal, and a carboxy-terminal domain of 13 zinc fingers. These proteins likely function as transcription activators. Although roles for these proteins in sex determination, Turner syndrome, and spermatogenesis have been proposed, the biological processes in which these proteins function are not known. No comprehensive studies of gene structure have been reported for any member of the ZFX\/ZFY family. Here, we report that mouse Zfx spans 50 kb and contains at least 11 exons. Exons 1 through 4 contain 5' untranslated sequences, exons 5 through 10 encode the acidic domain, exon 10 also encodes the putative nuclear localizing signal, and exon 11 encodes 13 zinc fingers and contains the 3' untranslated sequences. The 5' untranslated exons exhibit complex patterns of differential splicing. At the 5' end of this widely expressed gene, a 1.5-kb CpG island encompasses multiple transcription initiation sites as well as the first and second exons. The 5' portion of the CpG island displays promoter activity. This knowledge of the Zfx gene structure allowed us to reconstruct the splicing and retroposition events by which the Zfa gene on mouse chromosome 10 arose from a Zfx transcript.",

        "abstrak":"A specter is haunting China and the world—the specter of petty-bourgeois socialism. Why? Both Marxism and social democracy have lost their political and intellectual momentum worldwide. The disillusion about neoliberalism is also growing. Petty-bourgeois socialism can make some sense out of the current confusion in interpreting the institutional arrangements in today’s China. Moreover, since socialism should not perpetuate the proletarian status of the working class, the universal petty bourgeoisie seems to be the promise of the future.1 The central economic program of petty-bourgeois socialism is to establish a “socialist market economy,” especially through reforming and transforming the existing institutions of financial markets. The central political program of petty-bourgeois socialism is to promote “economic and political democracy.” The leading thinkers in the rich tradition of petty-bourgeois socialism are Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Ferdinand Lassalle, John Stuart Mill, Silvio Gesell, Fernand Braudel, James Meade, James Joyce, Charles Sabel, Fei Xiaotong, and Roberto M. Unger. The notion of the “petty bourgeoisie” used in this paper includes peasants. This is its main difference with the notion of the “middle classes” used in current Chinese discourse. But the concept of petty-bourgeois socialism can be associated with the current Chinese effort to build “xiaokang socialism.”",

        "abstrak":"Finding relationship between scientific articles is dire need of scholarly community. Current systems support the task to some extent, for example showing cited-by articles, related-articles etc. However, in many cases, these systems show a long list of related documents. For example, if a paper has been cited-by 500 papers, the Google Scholar shows the list of those 500 papers. The system itself is unable to recommend the most relevant cited-by articles for a cited article. This hinders the researchers to skim all of the cited paper to search the most suitable papers because of the fact that many researchers just cite the paper to give background study of the topic etc. In this way there is no strong relationship between the both papers. Therefore, there is a need for a system that can discover semantic relatedness between these documents and could recommend a few most relevant cited-by articles. The semantic relatedness could mean different for different people. In this paper, we consider the cited-by paper more relevant to cited paper if the cited paper has been referred within the cited-by paper's text more than a threshold value. We have empirically proved that Citation Frequency could be another measure to find semantically related set of articles. We have tested our system for a dataset of online journal such as: Journal of Universal Computer Science (J.

Therefore, on-line image processing of fundus is required for the more quantitative and time saving evaluation of vascular abnormalities and hemodynamics in microvascular bed in fundus.In this study electronic data processing techniques were introduced in order to develope a practical image processing system in ophthalmoscopic photography. Two experiments of different approaches were attempted, that is, firstly, computer image processing of a static photograph and, secondly the development of television picture scanning device to measure blood flow velocities.1. A 35mm picture film of fluorescence fundus photography was processed by means of a flying spot scanner into a digital picture with 256×256 pixels on a punched tape. This tape was then subjected to a computer image processing with a program to obtain outputs of contour maps and histograms of optical densities. Results showed that capillaries of diameter of as less as 20 micra could be distinguished. It seems that this kind of image processing technique can be used to evaluate quantitatively the leakage of fluorescent tracer through vascular walls.2. An elecronic data processing unit was deviced to measure blood flow velocities in microvessels. This was designed to sample out instantaneous optical density changes at two different points chosen arbitrarily on the screen of monitor television which was connected directly to the microscope through a television camera. Peaks of the curve of optical density changes showing the passage of a tracer such as fluorescent substance or plasma pocket were recorded on a penrecorder or a CRT. The blood velocity was thus calculated by the measurements of time delay between two peaks and the distance between two sampling points.Performance of the unit above stated was tested in the animal experiments of intra-vital microscopic observation of capillary blood flow in the rat mesentery. It was found that the capillary blood flow velocities up to 50mm\/sec could be measured with enough accuracy.Both these techniques seemed to provide a basis of on-line image processing of ophthalmoscopic photography with a high sensitive television camera connected directly to the microscope.",

The introductory chapter outlines the environmental, ecological and biogeographical factors influencing the marine biota, and the basic components of the fisheries in the Western Central Atlantic. Within the field guide, the sections on the resource groups are arranged phylogenetically according to higher taxonomic levels such as class, order and family. Each resource group is introduced by general remarks on the group, an illustrated section on technical terms and measurements and a key or guide to orders or families. Each family generally has an account summarising family diagnostic characters, biological and fisheries information, notes on similar families occurring in the area, a key to species, a checklist of species and a short list of relevant literature. Families that are less important to fisheries include an abbreviated family account and no detailed species information. Species in the important families are treated in detail (arranged alphabetically by genus and species) and include the species name, frequent synonyms and names of similar species, an illustration, FAO common name(s), diagnostic characters, biology and fisheries information, notes on geographical distribution and a distribution map. For less important species, abbreviated accounts are used.

        "abstrak":"The mechanism of action of purified wheat germ RNA ligase has been examined. ATP was absolutely required for the ligation of substrates containing 5'-OH or 5'-P and 2',3'-cyclic P or 2'-P termini. Ligation of 1 mol of 5'-P-2',3'-cyclic P-terminated poly(A) was accompanied by the hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP to 1 mol each of AMP and PPi. Purified RNA ligase catalyzed an ATP-PPi exchange reaction, specific for ATP and dATP, and formed a covalent enzyme-adenylate complex that was detected by autoradiography following incubation with [alpha-32P]ATP and separation of the products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A protein doublet with a molecular weight of approximately 110 kDa, the major product detected by silver staining, was labeled in these reactions. Isolated E-AMP complex was dissociated by the addition of ligatable poly(A), containing 5'-P-2',3'-cyclic P termini, to yield AMP and by the addition of PPi to yield ATP. The unique feature of the reactions leading to an exchange reaction between ATP and PPi and to the formation of an E-AMP complex was their marked stimulation (up to 400-fold) by the addition of RNA. This property distinguishes the wheat germ RNA ligase from other known RNA and DNA ligases which catalyze ATP-PPi exchange reactions and form E-AMP complexes in the absence of substrate. Thus, RNA appears to function in two capacities in the wheat germ system: as a cofactor, to stimulate the reaction of the enzyme with ATP, and as an authentic substrate for ligation.",

        "abstrak":"CYFRA 21-1 is a known lung cancer biomarker. In subjects with ovarian cancer (N = 159) and those with benign gynecological diseases (N = 53), serum CYFRA 21-1 reported a sensitivity (SN) of 44% and a specificity (SP) of 95% for ovarian cancer detection at a cut-off value of 2.4 ng\/mL using an ELISA assay (Hasholzner U, et al, 1994). Another report showed a SN of 41% and a SP of 95% for ovarian cancer (N = 37) versus benign ovarian cysts, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, bowel disease and liver cirrhosis (N = 168) using an ELISA assay (Tempfer C, et al, 1998). We carried out a pilot study to evaluate the serum CYFRA 21-1 as a biomarker for stratification of ovarian cancer risk in women with a pelvic mass. Methods: ARCHITECT CYFRA 21-1 was used to measure the levels of serum CYFRA 21-1. Single point frozen serum samples from 171 female subjects with a pelvic mass were randomly selected from the archive clinical trial described by Moore R et al (2009). Of the 171 subjects, 42 had epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), 5 with low malignant potential tumor (LMP) and 124 with benign pelvic masses. Results: To stratify EOC from benign pelvic masses and LMP, the following performance was obtained for serum CYFRA 21-1: Notes: The cutpoints were set at 1.2 and 1.8 ng\/mL to reach a 75% and 95% SP, respectively. Conclusion: Serum CYFRA 21-1 appears to be a useful biomarker for stratification of EOC from benign pelvic mass and LMP. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

The expected responses to the CCU expereince discussed are: anxiety, denial, depression, and aggressive sexual behavior. These usual behavioral responses have, at times, been referred to as \"a disease of medical progress\" or the so-called \"intensive care syndrome\". The nurse is in a key position to observe the patient's behavioral responses since she spends most of the time with the patient. When these behavioral patterns are considered as part of a normal patterns of adaptation, the nurse can utilize these for effective management of the patient's hospitalization experience as well as an indicator to the patient standpoint in his process of adaptation. It would be wise to mention that the detailed manifestations and primary causes of these behavioral responses should be part of the nurse's working knowledge and can be easily referred to in recent texts on coronary care nursing. The presentation progresses to specific discussion on nursing intervention of the behavioral responses. In summary, the Air Force novice nurse to a CCU area can be an equally contributory member on the Health Care Team if not compelled to place an exaggerated amount of attention on equipment, but focus more on the patient, leaving more technical learning until she becomes more aware of the unit administration and has the opportunity to attend a coronary training course.",

Animals-2to 3-year-old ponies, 6 control (group 1) and 6 treated (group 2). Procedure-Synovitis was induced in 1 midcarpal joint of group-2 ponies by intra-articular injections of LPS (0.02 pglkg of body weight), morphine (0.1 mglkg), and saline solution (group 2a) and morphine and saline solution alone in the contralateral midcarpal joint (group 2b). Articular cartilage sections and attached synovial membrane from the third carpal bones were examined by immunohistochemical distribution of interleukin 1 p, tumor necrosis factor (TNFI-~L, TNF receptors (P55, P75) and 3-B-3(-) epitopes, and by localization of proteoglycans (metachromatic staining). Proteoglycan extracts were assessed by metachromatic staining or western blotting and immunohistochemical staining, using anti-3-B-3 antibodies. Results-Enhanced immunoreactivity for the cytokines and receptors was found in inflamed synovial membrane and noncalcified cartilage (group 2a more than 2b). Metachromasia of the noncalcified cartilage was greater in group-1 than in group-2a and group-2b specimens. In group 2a, chondrocyte hypertrophy and enhanced immunoreactivity for 3-B-3(-) epitope in areas of increased cytokine immunoreactivity suggested possible phenotypic change of the chondrocytes in response to synovitis. lmmunohistochemical analysis by western blotting of proteoglycan extracts indicated strong 3-B-3(-1 epitope immunolocalization in group-2a, weaker staining in group2b, and barely detectable stain in group-1 specimens, which correlated with in situ immunolocalization. Conclusions-lntra-articular administration of LPS may be used to induce a synovial environment conducive to increased immunoreactivity of interleukin 1 p, TNF-a, and its receptors in equine synovial membrane and articular cartilage.

        "abstrak":"Conditions causing a reduction of oxygen availability (anoxia), such as stroke or diabetes, result in drastic changes in ion movements, levels of neurotransmitters and metabolites and subsequent neural death. Currently, there is no clinically available treatment for anoxia induced neural cell death resulting in drastic and permanent central nervous system dysfunction. However, there have been some exciting developments in experimentally induced anoxic conditions where several classes of drugs appear to significantly reduce neural cell death. This report aims to provide the foundations for understanding both the basic mechanisms involved in retinal ischaemic damage and experimental treatments used to prevent such damage. We discuss the normal release, actions and uptake of the fast retinal neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, in the vertebrate retina. Immunocytochemistry is used to demonstrate that both glutamate and GABA are found in the macaque retina. Following this is a discussion on how ischaemia may enhance neurotransmitter release or disrupt its uptake, thus causing an increase in extracellular concentration of these neurotransmitters and subsequent neuronal damage. The mechanisms involved in glutamate neurotoxicity are reviewed, because excess glutamate is the likely cause of retinal ischaemic damage. Finally, the mechanisms behind four possible modes of treatment of neurotransmitter toxicity and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Hopefully, further research in this area will lead to the development of a rational therapy for retinal, as well as cerebral ischaemia.",

In Exp. 1, (n=13 oestrous cycles) follicular and luteal development was monitored by ultrasonography and jugular blood samples were collected simultaneously on alternate days. Of 12 oestrous cycles, 9 (75%) had two waves of follicular activity and only 3 (25%) had three waves. The mean (+\/-S.E.M.) length of the oestrous cycle was shorter (P<0.05) in buffaloes with two waves than in those with three waves (21.2+\/-0.1 days versus 22.8+\/-0.1 days). In Exp. 2, follicular dynamics were compared in buffaloes undergoing spontaneous (n=12 oestrous cycles) and PGF(2alpha)-induced (n=9) regression of the corpus luteum (CL). The dynamics of ovulatory follicular growth during the 3 days before oestrus were similar (P>0.05) in buffaloes undergoing spontaneous and PGF(2alpha)-induced luteolysis. These results show that (1) the majority of buffaloes had a two wave pattern of follicular growth and emergence of a third wave was associated with a longer luteal phase, and (2) follicular dynamics during the 3 days before oestrus were similar in buffaloes undergoing spontaneous and PGF(2alpha)-induced luteolysis.",

A node's feature and topological structure information could be divided into different local aspects, while in many cases, not all the information but part of the information contained in several local aspects determine the relations among different nodes. Most of the existing works barely concern and identify the aspect influence from network embedding to our knowledge. We attempt to use local embeddings to represent local aspect information and propose InfomaxANE which encodes both global and local embeddings from the perspective of mutual information. The local aspect embeddings are forced to learn and extract different aspect information from nodes' features and topological structures by using orthogonal constraint. A theoretical analysis is also provided to further confirm its correctness and rationality. Besides, to provide complete and refined information for local encoders, we also optimize feature aggregation in SAGE with different structures: feature similarities are concerned and aggregator is seperated from encoder. InfomaxANE is evaluated on both node clustering and node classification tasks (including both transductive and inductive settings) with several benchmark datasets, the results show the outperformance of InfomaxANE over competitive baselines.

Through precise analysis, a linear relationship between output capacitance and the inclination angle of the structure is extracted which is attributed to the parallel plate structure of the capacitance sensor and tilt-dependent movement of the dielectric liquid at various angles. Our proposed inclinometer has three structures with 1, 2, and 4 parallel plate micro capacitors in each configuration. Capacitors in different structures have a common plate while other plates are separate, so different capacitors are realized. The sensor cavity is cylindrical and is half filled with silicone oil. Tilt application to the sensor leads to oil movement in the cavity and variation of different capacitors in the structure. For an analytical expression, we introduce  $C_{\\mathrm {out}}$  as a function of different capacitors in each structure to obtain a linear and continuous relation with tilt. Furthermore, we simulate each structure using COMSOL Multiphysics and then test the fabricated samples. Extracted results from analysis, simulation, and performance tests are in a good accordance. Obtained results reveal that the double capacitor structure has a high sensitivity of 32.2 mV\/° in the range of ±90° while four-capacitor structure has a measurement range of ±180° (full turnover) with a sensitivity of 10.1 mV\/°. High sensitivity, wide linear range besides simplicity of the structure, are advantages of the proposed inclination micro-sensor.",

PBP 2, which is needed for longitudinal growth of the cell but not for septum formation, was significantly reduced in minicell membranes. This observation is consistent with the fact that minicells contain very little sidewall material and raises the possibility that the specialized function of PBP 2 may be determined or regulated by its uneven topographical distribution in the membrane.

It was shown that addition of boron leads to the formation of an interconnected and rigid boride network delimiting the grain boundaries of the martensitic matrix. A very refined structure was formed as result of the high cooling rates imposed to the molten alloy during the HVOF process. The specific wear rates of the HVOF coatings were about tenfold lower than the boron-free supermartensitic stainless steel, lying in the order of 10−5 mm3\/N m. The refined boride skeleton along the HVOF coating was found to be effective to reduce the materials’ removal from the exposed softer martensitic matrix. While the supermartensitic stainless steel master alloy and the mild steel substrate displayed severe adhesive wear, the HVOF coatings exhibited mild delamination wear at low sliding velocities (10 and 20 cm\/s) and abrasive wear at the highest tested velocity (40 cm\/s). The studied boron-modified supermartensitic HVOF coatings are an interesting approach to protect the surface of inexpensive steel substrates against wear.",

The data include the population of cases indicted for capital murder in Harris County (Houston), Texas, from 1992 to 1999 (n = 504). The findings suggest that victim social status has a robust influence on the ultimate state sanction: Death was more likely to be sought and imposed on behalf of high-status victims who were integrated, sophisticated, conventional, and respectable.

Piero Sraffa started one phase of that revolution — the one in value theory — but his commitment to the Keynesian revolution was very slight. Indeed one could say that the two Cambridge revolutions, one started by Sraffa in 1926 and the other by Keynes in 1936 (although known earlier in Cambridge), were in contradiction with each other by the 1960s. The second Sraffa revolution begun in 1960 was a fulfilment of the one previously launched in 1926 but it had a value and capital theory that sat uncomfortably with the Keynesian revolution. Despite his intimate acquaintance with and encouragement of Sraffa’s work, Keynes in his General Theory took in his value theory a pre-Sraffa Marshallian line as far as he took any. Joan Robinson who with her exceptional rigour had worked out the consequences of the first two revolutions, Sraffa 1926 and Keynes 1936, bore the brunt of reconciling the second Sraffa revolution with the Keynesian revolution (See essays in Eatwell and Milgate, 1983).",

Electromyographic activity of semimembranosus and biceps femoris were sampled during testing. The right-left knee laxity difference of control subjects did not alter between test types (active x = 0.6 mm ; passive x = 0.4 mm ). However, the average involved\/non-involved knee laxity difference of ACL-deficient subjects was greater in passive ( x = 4.0 mm ) compared with active tests ( x = 0.9 mm ). Hamstring activity varied widely within both subject groups during active testing. It was concluded that hamstring activity should be monitored during arthrometric assessment of knee laxity to ensure reliable passive ATT results and to provide insight into knee stabilization strategies used by ACL-deficient patients during active tests.",

        "abstrak":"A one-dimensional (1D) model of oxygen transport in the diffusion media of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is presented, which considers convection perpendicular to the electrode in addition to diffusion. The resulting analytical expression of the convecto-diffusive impedance is obtained using a convection–diffusion equation instead of a diffusion equation in the case of classical Warburg impedance. The main hypothesis of the model is that the convective flux is generated by the evacuation of water produced at the cathode which flows through the porous media in vapor phase. This allows the expression of the convective flux velocity as a function of the current density and of the water transport coefficient α (the fraction of water being evacuated at the cathode outlet). The resulting 1D oxygen transport impedance neglects processes occurring in the direction parallel to the electrode that could have a significant impact on the cell impedance, like gas consumption or concentration oscillations induced by the measuring signal. However, it enables us to estimate the impact of convection perpendicular to the electrode on PEMFC impedance spectra and to determine in which conditions the approximation of a purely diffusive oxygen transport is valid. Experimental observations confirm the numerical results.",

        "tahun_terbit":1998,
        "abstrak":"Purpose: The normal pattern of sensation during the tonic phase of cystometric bladder filling was evaluated in a group of young healthy volunteers. Materials and Methods: A total of 38 healthy volunteers 19 to 28 years old described the sensations they perceived while sitting during medium fill cystometry after the bladder was filled through a urethral catheter with saline at body temperature. Results: Of the subjects 4 had unstable bladder contractions that corresponded with some sensations reported, and 34 with a stable bladder perceived a first sensation of filling, first desire to void and strong desire to void. Each sensation was easily distinguishable from the others. Bladder volumes at the different sensations as well as detrusor pressures strongly correlated with each other. Conclusions: Although sensations reported during cystometric bladder filling are subjective, they have a normal pattern. Since these sensations are easily distinguished from each other and occur at interrelated volumes, they probably correspond with specific physiological mechanisms as suggested previously. Therefore, evaluation of these sensations could provide additional relevant information during urodynamics. It has been described previously that bladder distension can evoke sensations, particularly those related to stretch and distension, of varying quality and origin.13 Adequate sensory input is the prerequisite for conscious bladder control,4 and pathological bladder sensation may cause serious symptoms and complications.S.6 Therefore, the evaluation of sensation is clinically useful. Sensations reported during urodynamic investigations are subjective and investigators might be cautious about their diagnostic value. Although some technical investigations are currently used to evaluate objectively sensory innervation of the lower urinary tract,7 they do not involve the perception of sensations, such as desire to void and of full bladder, which guide daily urinary behavior. Bladder filling sensation was studied in a group of healthy volunteers to determine the value of this investigative technique.",

The results show that:( 1) The relationship between agglomeration and pollution is inverted- U- shaped and technological innovation acting as an important factor determines the location of the turning point.( 2) Almost all of the provinces locate on the left side of the inverted- U- shaped curve,which means China's industrial agglomeration has not possessed a positive environmental externality.( 3) Coastal provinces achieve a higher position on the curve than inland provinces,which means that with higher level of industrial agglomeration in coastal provinces led to more pollution. However,the emission abatement induced by technological innovation of inland provinces is much more significant than coastal provinces,which means that the positive externality of industrial agglomeration of coastal provinces is decreasing and that its development of agglomeration has entered a bottleneck period.",

Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded. The patients were classified into two groups with respect to received dose of bevacizumab as follows: group F (n = 46) (full dose of bevacizumab—0.625 mg\/0.025 ml) and group L (n = 45) (low dose (one tenth) of bevacizumab—0.0625 mg\/0.025 ml).ResultsBoth treatment dose regimens have similar outcomes. Moreover, the mean retinal vascularization time seemed to be significantly higher in group F compared to group L, 168 ± 65 and 97 ± 29 days, respectively (p < 0.001). Disappearance of plus sign is observed earlier in group F (2.45 ± 1.7 vs 3.66 ± 2.46 days, respectively, p = 0.03).ConclusionsThe low dose (0.0625 mg) of IVB treatment was effective as full (0.625 mg) dose in ROP treatment. Moreover, our results showed that low-dose treatment might provide faster retinal vascularization than the regular used dose. On the other hand, disappearance of the plus sign takes longer time in patients treated with low dose compared to eyes treated with full dose of IVB that should be taken into account.",

The results showed that there were significant differences in growth of tomato seedlings under treatments of different proportions of R and B light. The plant height, specific leaf area and intercellular CO2 concentration of tomato seedlings were significantly promoted by R light, while Fv\/Fm and χPS2 were decreased, the root growth was inhibited as the root activity declined, so that the seedling index was reduced. The seedling growth was significantly suppressed under B light and the chlorophyll content was decreased, while the chlorophyll a\/b was enhanced. Furthermore, combination of R+B light was be-neficial to the growth and development of tomato seedlings, and the plant dry mass, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic performance were significantly increased under 3R1B.

The overall aims of the project were: (1) to raise awareness on sanitation and personal hygiene; and (2) to enhance participation in providing and improving basic sanitation facilities and activities; and (3) to help school personnel to develop a more practical approach to the teaching and learning of health education. The project was centred on access to the minimum requirements of primary health care (PHe): basic sanitation, water supply, and health education concerning proper sanitation and personal hygiene. This is in line with Kenya's health development policies of promotive and preventive health care and the National Guidelines for the implementation of PHC which call for intersectoral collaboration. The Community-Based Health Care (CBHC) approach was used as a strategy to promote health in the Getembe Zone primary Schools. This approach requires informed and active participants. To this end, Health Education, an important element of PHC was used to address the sanitation and hygiene issues in the school. The results showed notable achievements in sanitation facilities and activities. The number of pit latrines increased significantly from 230 at the beginning of the project to 287 at the time of evaluation. Sixty three pit latrines were under construction. Twelve schools had provided their pupils with urinals and 7 had water supply provided in their premises. Only 2 schools",

The reduced modulus decreased from about 4.40 GPa to 3.64 GPa over this temperature range. The plasticity indices at all measurement temperatures were lower than the critical value of 0.875, characterizing material “sink-in”, rather than “pile-up” during measurements. The plasticity index showed a non-monotonic trend, with a minimum value at around 70 °C. Analysis of indentation stress relaxation data, obtained at different temperatures, was also performed using generalized Maxwell viscoelastic models. From these analyses, a relaxation mode, with a characteristic relaxation time of approximately 0.5 s, was evident. The characteristic time remained relatively unchanged over the temperature range of 25 to 100 °C. However, the relaxation modulus associated with this mode showed the expected decrease with increase in temperature.",

We find that the most reactive site shifts from the collinear X-end toward sideways as the mass number of X increases( i.e. from Br to I).

Therefore, for traveling people, self-driving car will be a new space for entertainment. However, there is a lack of literature on caching for entertainment content in self-driving car. Therefore, in order to address this challenge, we propose a deep learning approach for in-car caching in Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), where convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in self-driving car for classifying people on board, in order to provide them high quality of entertainment contents. The classification is based on age, gender, and location. However, CNN results are insufficient to decide on which entertainment contents to cache. Therefore, the self-driving car needs to be assisted by MEC and data center (DC). At DC, long short-term memory (LSTM) framework is used for predicting content’s probability for being requested in specific areas by certain categories of people. LSTM results are deployed to MEC servers located at the edge of a network in close proximity to the self-driving cars. Based on profile of people on board, the self-driving car can request MEC server the predicted results from DC, and compare it with its CNN results for deciding on which entertainment contents to cache that are appropriate to the people on board. The numerical results show that our proposal can be easily implemented in a realistic self-driving car environment.",

Participants with CVD were identified based on self-reported personal interview data on a broad range of health conditions—congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina, stroke, or heart attack. Appropriate sample weights were used to provide a national estimate. Results of prevalence of CKD in U.S. adults with self-reported CVD are presented in Table 1. The prevalence of moderately to severely decreased renal impairment based on eGFR below 60 ml\/min\/1.73m2 was 24.9%: 14.1% with Stage 3a, 7.8% with Stage 3b, and 3.0% with Stage 4 or 5. The prevalence of mildly decreased renal impairment (stage 2, eGFR=60-90 ml\/min\/1.73m2) was 45.2%: 36.8% with UACR 300mg\/g (severely increased albuminuria). This study confirms the high prevalence of CKD in CVD, and provides insights into distribution by CKD categories based on the KDIGO 2012 classification. Disclosure T.

The second model was decapitation with timed delays of 0, 15, 60 and 240 minutes. There was no decline in K-pNPPase activity after total ischemia produced by decapitation. Thus, the model of partial ischemia was more deleterious to the cation pump enzyme than was the model of total ischemia. All brains contained endogenous K-pNPPase inhibitors. Boiled supernatant fractions inhibited K-pNPPase activity by about 50-60% while Amicon filtrates of brain homogenate inhibited about 12%. Factors in normal and ischemic brain may modify the activity of the cation pump enzyme, but no differences in inhibitory effects were found between normal and ischemic brain extracts.",

The MISPE technique has several advantages over the conventional SPE. The evidence of better selectivity and affinity towards target analytes over general purpose sorbents such as alkyl-functionalized silica (C18) is well documented in literature. Several novel advances have been done in the application of the MISPE technique. These include magnetization of the imprinted polymer and using the imprinted polymers as functional organic frameworks on nanoparticle surfaces. However, the MISPE technique also has its own drawbacks. This chapter therefore discusses molecularly imprinted polymers as novel adsorbents for SPE extraction as well as the challenges and possible areas for potential improvement that can make the applicability of MISPE in sample preparation and preconcentration to reach new heights.",

Although the skin from 52·3 per cent of the donors possessed some detectable residual microbial contamination after surgical body preparation and skin removal, such contamination was limited to an average of 1–4 areas per body, leaving 86 per cent of all skin obtained free from detectable contamination and suitable for use as biological wound dressings. The number of skin samples tested per donor body determined the accuracy of detection of the presence of contamination. Testing one skin sample per donor body yielded a correct skin assessment 92 per cent of the time, while testing five skin samples increased the accuracy to 96 per cent, and testing ten skin samples yielded a 99-9 per cent accuracy in detection of skin contamination.

The clinical characteristics of 42 ambulant HCM patients followed up for up to 5 years were investigated. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, non-fatal stroke, admission due to congestive heart failure (CHF), or episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia\/fibrillation. The MACE-free survival during the 5-year follow-up period was 76% according to Kaplan–Meier analysis. HCM-related death occurred in 3 (7%) patients and SCD occurred in 2 (5%) patients. Additionally, 3 (7%) patients were admitted to the hospital due to CHF. Meanwhile, sustained VT was detected in one (2%) of the patients who received ICD implantation and subsequently terminated with antitachycardia pacing using an ICD. The patients with HCM exhibiting left ventricular outflow obstruction (HOCM) had a slightly lower MACE-free survival rate than those with neither HOCM nor dilated-HCM (dHCM) (71% versus 81%, log-rank P = 0.581). Furthermore, the patients with dHCM demonstrated a significantly lower MACE-free survival rate than those with neither HOCM nor dHCM (33% versus 81%, log-rank P = 0.029). In the AHC Registry targeting current Japanese HCM patients, we demonstrated that many HCM patients continue to suffer from MACE despite the development of various treatments for HCM.

Unfortunately, collecting dialogues data to train these systems can be labour-intensive, especially for data-hungry Deep Learning models. Therefore, we propose an automatic procedure able to generate plausible dialogues from recommender systems datasets. People have information needs of varying complexity, which can be solved by an intelligent agent able to answer questions formulated in a proper way, eventually considering user context and preferences. Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) assist online users in their information-seeking and decision making tasks by supporting an interactive process [1] with the aim of finding the most appealing items according to the user preferences. Unfortunately, collecting dialogues data required for the training phase of these systems can be really labour-intensive, especially for the latest data-hungry Deep Learning models. For this reason, synthetic dialogue datasets can be extremely useful in order to bootstrap effective dialogue systems able to support a goal-oriented conversation with the user. Therefore, we propose an automatic procedure able to generate plausible dialogues directly from well-known recommender systems datasets exploiting data coming from the Linked Open Data Cloud and contextual information related to the user. Given a user u and his\/her set of binary preferences, we trained a decision tree from the user u preferences expressed towards items represented using Linked Open Data binary features extracted from the Wikidata knowledge base. In particular, each pair predicate-object is represented as a binary feature which is 1 if The dialogue datasets generated from MovieLens 1M and MovieTweetings datasets can be found at: http:\/\/github.com\/swapUniba\/ConvRecSysDataset. The source code of the automatic procedure for generating conversational recommender systems datasets will be released when the paper will be accepted. 3 http:\/\/www.wikidata.org the knowledge base contains the triple (item, predicate, object), 0 otherwise. The considered predicates are wdt:P57 (director), wdt:P161 (cast member), wdt:P136 (genre) . The dialogue generation procedure is an iterative algorithm which is executed until all user preferences have been used. At each step of the dialog generation procedure, a top-n list of items composed by positive and negative items is generated by randomly choosing from positive and negative preferences of the given user u. Then, paths from the root of the decision tree to the consistently classified examples are exploited to generate a sequence of questions, randomly chosen according to a binomial distribution over the item features, to elicit user preferences. Depending from the percentage of positive items in the top-n, a “refine” step is triggered which extends the dialog with additional questions that lead to a list of suggestions which contains only positive items. Table 1 shows a conversation generated by applying the designed procedure to the well-known MovieLens 1M recommender systems dataset. In the first part of the conversation, utterances with the aim of introducing the user are generated by exploiting the contextual information included in the dataset.

Regardless of knowing the entire DAG beforehand, obtaining an optimal schedule in a parallel machine is a NP-hard problem. Moreover, many programming tools propose the use of scheduling techniques based on list strategies. This paper presents an analysis of scheduling algorithms for multithread programs in a dynamic scenario where threads are created and destroyed during execution. We introduce an algorithm to convert DAGs, describing applications as tasks, into Directed Cyclic Graphs (DCGs) describing the same application designed in a multithread programming interface. Our algorithm covers case studies described in previous works, successfully mapping from the abstract level of graphs to the application environment. These mappings preserve the guarantees offered by the abstract model, providing efficient scheduling of dynamic programs that follow the intended multithread model. We conclude the paper presenting some performance results we obtained by list schedulers in dynamic multithreaded environments. We also compare these results with the best scheduling we could obtain with similar static task schedulers.",

Studies using CI simulations have not shown a true \"bilateral\" advantage, but a \"better ear\" effect and have demonstrated that performance decreases with increasing basalward shift in insertion depth. This study aimed to determine whether there is a bilateral advantage for CI simulations with interaurally matched insertions and the extent to which performance is affected by interaural insertion depth mismatch. Speech perception in noise and self-reported ease of listening were measured using matched bilateral, mismatched bilateral and unilateral CI simulations over four insertion depths for seventeen normal hearing listeners. Speech scores and ease of listening reduced with increasing basalward shift in (interaurally matched) insertion depth. A bilateral advantage for speech perception was only observed when the insertion depths were interaurally matched and deep. No advantage was observed for small to moderate interaural insertion-depth mismatches, consistent with a better ear effect. Finally, both measures were poorer than expected for a better ear effect for large mismatches, suggesting that misalignment of the electrode arrays may prevent a bilateral advantage and detrimentally affect perception of diotically presented speech.",

        "tahun_terbit":2005,
        "abstrak":"Research is beginning to outline a role for the endocannabinoid system in cocaine addiction. Human and animal studies indicate that exogenous cannabinoids modulate the acute rewarding effects of cocaine. These studies, however, cannot directly investigate the necessity of endocannabinoid transmission in cocaine addiction. Studies that do offer a direct assessment show that neither pharmacological antagonism nor deletion of the CB1 receptor alters the acute rewarding effects of cocaine. In contrast, CB1 receptors appear to be involved in the association of cocaine reward with environmental cues and reinstatement of cocaine self-administration. Together, these results point to CB1 receptor antagonists as potential anti-craving compounds in the treatment of cocaine addiction. Given the limitations of human population studies, animal research may be useful in discerning causal inferences between cannabis and cocaine use. While animal research suggests cannabis use may precipitate cocaine relapse, cross-sensitization between cannabinoids and cocaine has not been demonstrated and CB1 receptors do not mediate behavioral sensitization to cocaine. The effect of acute or chronic cocaine on endocannabinoid transmission in reward-related areas of the brain is relatively under-researched. Acute cocaine administration increases anandamide levels in the striatum, an effect that is mediated by dopamine D2-like receptors. Conversely, chronic cocaine exposure has no effect on anandamide, but decreases 2-arachidonylglycerol levels in the limbic forebrain. This review highlights research indicating that the endocannabinoid system may subserve certain aspects of cocaine addiction and suggests avenues for future investigation.",

Using a new dataset based on Almanacs from 1873 and 1888, we are able to test if (i) the cultural component, (ii) immigrants' on-the-job-skills, and (iii) their ethnic schools influenced the historical accumulation of human capital. No robust evidence was found for the first two explanations. On the other hand, for the 1910s, German schools had strong positive impacts on enrollment, not only for private, but also for state schools, a result which suggests the occurrence of spillover and contagion effects. Such impact tends, however, to dissipate over time and it does not survive for current educational performance. In addition, the paper shows that the pathdependence of education is conditional on the type of school: while there is a positive persistence in enrollment in private schools over the 20th century, enrollment in state schools depends negatively on its historical levels, reflecting convergence toward 100% enrollment rates in primary schooling. Furthermore, current stocks of human capital, measured by illiteracy and years of education, are shown to be strongly impacted by completion and enrollment in state schools back in the 1910s.",

If these functional alterations were correlated with the morphology of the myeloid cell population, the most prominent finding was a highly significant correlation between decreased intracellular killing and degree of admixture of myelocytes and metamyelocytes to the mature cells. The data suggest that the main qualitative functional defect in CML as well as in AML is the inefficient intracellular killing capacity displayed by myelocytes and metamyelocytes. All, but one patient, were without signs of bacterial infection at the time of testing. The data thus add to the phenomena, previously observed in this laboratory concerning the killing defect, in severely infected patients, a defect which was found to be correlated in part with the degree of “shift to the left” of the myeloid cell population.",

We present our initial experience of patients treated using day-case RPN and released from our hospital on the same day, focusing on patient selection, safety and patient satisfaction using the EVAN-G validated questionnaire. Results Between September 2016 and September 2019, 429 RPN were performed and 82 patients were consecutively selected for day-case RPN. Patients were managed using transperitoneal RPN with off-clamp tumorectomy for 66\/82 cases. Mean tumor size was 2.7 ± 1.2 cm. There were no immediate severe postoperative complications; 7\/82 patients were kept under observation overnight and discharged the following day. The follow-up at day 30 indicated postoperative complications, readmissions, and mortality rates of 1.2, 1.2, and 0%, respectively.

DNA Polζ also appears to be involved in the somatic hypermutability that occurs during development of the immune response. The results from a variety of genetic and enzymological investigations have started to delineate the cellular roles of these enzymes, but a number of important issues have not yet been resolved and much remains to be learned. Questions concerning the possible existence of other subunits to these enzymes, of their possible association with one another or with other proteins, of the nature of their enzymatic activities and of the relative roles played by these and other DNA polymerases in the bypass of different kinds of DNA damage, require further investigation.

Despite the straightforward statement of the problem, its solution is non-trivial. We offer an algorithm and discuss its practical applications.

INTERVENTIONS: By means of a home interview, a questionnaire to determine whether the interviewees practiced regular physical exercise was filled out (physical activity carried out in their free time, three or more days per week). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The most notable finding was that 47.3% of the whole sample practiced physical exercise (49.5% of men and 45.3% of women, NS). The youngest (15 to 29) were those who did most physical exercise (58.7%): this was statistically significant in comparison with the other age groups (p < 0.01).

        "abstrak":"Computer self-efficacy is a significant factor that differentiates adopters and non-adopters of computer technology among university faculty. Faculty who judge themselves unable to use computers effectively and confidently will not adopt them in the classroom even when the hardware and software are available to them. In this case study, a program was designed and implemented to enhance faculty computer self-efficacy. Using Bandura's four sources of efficacy information as a guide, the program consisted of showcases, seminars, workshops and funding. The in service program had a positive impact on both faculty and administration. The in service program was a cost-effective way for administrators to support faculty in the use of computer technology in instruction. The faculty gained confidence and enhanced their computer self- efficacy resulting in a community of faculty with shared interests in using computers in the classroom. Components of the program, its evaluation and recommendations for implementation are discussed. \n \n \n \nHigher education cannot realize the potential impact of computer technology until faculty are comfortable using technology for instructional activities. Current computer hardware and related information technologies are now faster, possess greater memory, and are available at lower costs than their predecessors. Faculty in higher education can and should make imaginative use of these technologies to enrich the learning environment and support student learning. Many faculty are sufficiently comfortable with the technology to use it in the classroom; however, many others are not. Indeed, the pace of the information revolution has left many faculty members bewildered and unsure of how or when they can utilize this ever-changing phenomenon. Academic administrators must, therefore, develop mechanisms to help faculty become comfortable with the use of computers in their instructional activities (Olivier and Shapiro, 1993). \n \n \n \nThe purpose of this article is to describe an in service program designed to improve instructional computer use by faculty at a university campus. The authors found that computer self-efficacy is related to adoption among the faculty on this campus as it is at others (Faseyitan and Hirschbuhl, 1992). Therefore, the program objective was to enhance the computer self-efficacy of the faculty and their desire to integrate computers into instruction. \n \n \n \nFirst, we establish how improved self-efficacy is linked to computer usage in instruction, establishing the framework for the in service program. Next, a detailed description of the program is presented. Finally, we present an evaluation and an assessment of the impact of the in service program on the self-efficacy of faculty at our campus.",

A realistic and critical theory of transnational justice needs to begin with an analysis of the relations of rule and\/or domination, whether within, between, or beyond states. And because reflexive justice requires structures of justification whereby those subject to rule or domination can become the normative authorities co-determining them, a complex account of transnational justice and democracy results. ”",

In this study, thrombin generation (TG) test was used to assess the efficacy of rFVIIa ex vivo in a Glanzmann patient with inhibitor, who had a surgery for cholesteatoma. The day before surgery, TG capacity in platelet rich plasma was significantly diminished (Endogenous thrombin potential = 637nM x min) in comparison with the normal control group (1338+\/-353 nM x min). Thirty minutes after the first infusion of 90 microg\/kg of rFVIIa, TG was increased by 59% (1010 nM x min). rFVIIa was administered as intravenous bolus injection of 90 microg\/kg q x 2h during the first 24h, than 66microg\/kg q x 2h during 24h and 53 microg\/kg q x 2h on the post-operative day 3. Residual TG capacity measured before rFVIIa administration mostly remained above 1000nM x min and the coagulation capacity was not significantly modified after a new injection of rFVIIa. The fibrin network was studied with 3D confocal microscopy using clots obtained with TG test. After rFVIIa infusion, the fibrin network was tighter in comparison with the sample before rFVIIa injection.

Digital impressions were taken immediately after implant placement, and implant-supported splinted temporary bridges were fabricated through a full digital approach (model free) and delivered within 24 hours. Final restorations were finished 4 months after surgery via traditional impression technique. Subjects were followed 1 year after treatment. 3D impression deviations were analyzed by comparing the digital and conventional impression methods. Time costs for the full digital approach were recorded. Implant survival rate, marginal bone levels were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll the recruited subjects finished this study. Seventy-four implants were surgically placed and immediately loaded with 34 temporary bridges fabricated through a full digital approach. Digital impression deviation compared with traditional impression method was 27.43 ± 13.47 μm. Time costs for chair side and laboratory were 32.55 ± 4.73 and 69.30 ± 10.87 minutes, respectively. Marginal bone alterations were -1.58 mm and -1.69 mm at the time of 4 and 12 months after surgery. The implants had a survival rate of 100% at the 1-year follow-up time.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImmediate loading of multiple implants in partial edentulous (2-4 teeth span) patients with full digital approach is clinically applicable.

Such agreements can cover outdoor facilities alone or may be more comprehensive by also including indoor facilities. Our aim was to: 1) estimate the prevalence of shared use agreements and facility types covered among U.S. municipalities and 2) identify differences in prevalence by municipality characteristics. The 2014 National Survey of Community-based Policy and Environmental Supports for Healthy Eating and Active Living is a representative survey of US municipalities (n=2029). Data were analyzed using survey weights to create national estimates. Logistic and multinomial regression models determined odds ratios adjusting for municipality characteristics. Among 1930 municipalities with a school, 41.6% had a shared use agreement as reported by a local official, 45.6% did not, and 12.8% did not know. Significant differences in prevalence existed by population size, rural\/urban status, poverty prevalence, median education level, and census region; however, after adjustment for other municipality characteristics significant differences remained only by population size, median education level, and census region. Among municipalities with a shared use agreement, 59.6% covered both outdoor and indoor facilities, 5.5% covered indoor facilities only, and 34.9% covered outdoor facilities only. Opportunities exist to expand the use of shared use agreements particularly in municipalities with small populations, lower education levels, and in the South, and to promote more comprehensive shared use agreements that include both indoor and outdoor facilities.",

Unlike its prototype, the Anabaena reductase is absolutely dependent on a divalent cation for activity, Ca2+ being the most effective. In addition, the Anabaena reductase shows a simple pattern of alloteric control by deoxyribonucleotides. CTP reduction is stimulated by dATP, GTP by dTTP, and ATP by dGTP. No reduction is observed in the absence of effectors, and none of the effectors inhibits enzyme activity. Thus, the Anabaena ribonucleotide reductase can be more easily studied by kinetic analysis than the Lactobacillus enzyme, and should provide additional information as to the mechanism of action of this enzyme in a photosynthetic organism.",

        "abstrak":"BACKGROUND\nIn dual-frequency (DF) harmonic imaging, the second harmonic signal at second harmonic (2f0) frequency and the inter-modulation harmonic signal at fundamental (f0) frequency are simultaneously imaged for spectral compounding. When the phase-encoded Golay pair is utilized to improve the harmonic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), however, the DF imaging suffers from range side lobe artifacts due to spectral cross-talk with other harmonic components at DC and third harmonic (3f0) frequency.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this study, a supplementary Golay pair is developed to suppress the range side lobes in combination with the original Golay pair. Since the phase code of the DC interference cannot be manipulated, the supplementary Golay is designed to reverse the polarity of the 3f0 interference and the f0 signal while keeping the 2f0 signal unchanged. For 2f0 imaging, the echo summation of the supplementary and the original Golay can cancel the 3f0 interference. On the contrary, the echo difference between the two Golay pairs can eliminate the DC interference for f0 imaging.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHydrophone measurements indicate that the range side lobe level (RSLL) increases with the signal bandwidth of DF harmonic imaging. By using the combination of the two Golay pairs, the achievable suppression of RSLL can be 3 and 14 dB, respectively for the f0 and 2f0 harmonic signal. B-mode phantom imaging also verifies the presence of range side lobe artifacts when only the original Golay pair is utilized. In combination with the supplementary Golay pair, the artifacts are effectively suppressed. The corresponding range side lobe magnitude reduces by about 8 dB in 2f0 imaging but remains unchanged in f0 imaging. Meanwhile, the harmonic SNR improves by 8-10 dB and the contrast-to-noise ratio of harmonic image increases from about 1 to 1.2 by spectral compounding.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor DF tissue harmonic imaging, the spectral cross-talk in Golay excitation results in severe range side lobe artifacts. To restore the image quality, two particular phase-encoded Golay pairs are required to perform either echo summation or difference for elimination of unwanted harmonic components.",

The results also showed that subsequent exposure to CdCl(2) for 2 weeks after initial exposure to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) markedly enhanced the transformation frequency.

During the 1920s and 1930s (and even during WWII when, after Pearl Harbor, Poland and Japan were technically at war), Polish and Japanese intelligence services collaborated closely against the Soviet Union. Of course the Soviet Union knew of this and infiltrated the Japanese and Polish services (the extent is naturally not easy to determine). Still Polish-Japanese undercover work was serious enough to concern Stalin deeply. Iagoda, a past master of counterintelligence, carried out “Trest”-like operations in the Far East, right up until the Great Terror, i.e., until he was replaced by Ezhov. Ezhov attacked Iagoda’s operations and decimated his foreign intelligence cadres. This is little known background to the Great Terror. It is not that there were many spies (in fact there were not many) or that the Great Terror struck actual “spies” (probably very few if any), but the fact of the matter was that the Great Terror took place against the backdrop of fierce international intelligence battles. German connections are sometimes mentioned, but Polish-Japanese connections are not, even though they appear to have been more important than the German ones.

We developed a novel, yet relatively straightforward image processing framework for WM myelin content estimation based on earlier work by Glasser, et al. We first co-register the structural MRI data to correct for motion. Then, background areas are masked out via a joint T1w and T2 foreground mask computed. Raw T1w\/T2w-ratios images are computed next. For purpose of calibration across subjects, we first coarsely segment the fat-rich facial regions via an atlas co-registration. Linear intensity rescaling based on median T1w\/T2w-ratio values in those facial regions yields calibrated T1w\/T2wratio images. Mean values in lobar regions are evaluated using standard statistical analysis to investigate their interaction with age at scan. Several lobes have strongly positive significant interactions of age at scan with the computed T1w\/T2w-ratio. Most regions do not show sex effects. A few regions show no measurable effects of change in myelin content change within the first few weeks of postnatal development, such as cingulate and CC areas, which we attribute to sample size and measurement variability. We developed and evaluated a novel way to estimate white matter myelin content for use in studies of brain white matter development.",

        "tahun_terbit":2004,
        "abstrak":"Dear Sir, Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and doubles the risk of myocardial infarction, sudden death, and stroke in patients with hypertension [1]. The mechanisms by which smoking might contribute to the development of cardiovascular complications include an acute increase in heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), cardiac contractility, and myocardial oxygen demand, primarily mediated by nicotine-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system [2,3]. Previous studies have reported that beta-blocking agents attenuate the acute tachycardia induced by cigarette smoking but have little effect on the BP increase [4-9]. Furthermore, such drugs have been shown to enhance the vasoconstrictor effect of smoking on the systemic and coronary circulation, presumably due to the unopposed c~-adrenergic receptor stimulation [4-6, 10]. We recently evaluated the influence of acute oral administration of celiprolol, a new ~rselective antagonist with ~2agonist and mild a2-adrenergic blocking properties [11,12], on cardiovascular effects of cigarette smoking in normotensive smokers. Twenty-seven healthy smokers, 21 males and 6 females, aged 20-41 years, were studied. On the study morning the subjects presented having fasted from 21h00 on the preceding evening and having refrained from cigarette smoking and from drinking caffeine-containing beverages during this period. According to a double-blind, crossover design, each subject was asked to smoke four cigarettes during a 1-hour period, 120 minutes after oral administration of celiprolol 200 mg or placebo. BP and HR were measured immediately before and 10 minutes after each smoking episode. BP was measured using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer (I-V Korotkoff phase); HR was evaluated by pulse palpation. Doubleproduct (SBP x HR), which is considered a reliable index of oxygen consumption [13], was also calculated. The statistical analysis of the data was performed by analysis of variance and Student's t-test. The main results, expressed as mean values of SBP, DBP, HR, and double product before and after each smoking episode, are shown in Table 1. Under placebo, cigarette smoking induced an increase in SBP, HR, and double product, which was statistically significant after each smoking episode. DBP values were significantly affected only by the third and fourth cigarette smoked. After each smoking episode, the recovery towards baseline presmoking SBP and HR values became progressively slower, with a consequent progressive increase in the baseline values between the smoking episodes. These findings indicate that in heavy smokers the smoking-induced rise in BP values also persists in the intervals between smoking a cigarette and the following intervals, thus confirming previous reports [8,9,13]. The negative association between BP and cigarette smoking shown by epidemiological studies [14] could be explained by the fact that in such studies BP values were usually measured after a period of abstinence from smoking. Acute celiprolol administration reduced the baseline BP and HR mean values before the hour-long smoking period and significantly attenuated both the SBP and HR increase due to smoking, with a consequent reduction in the double product; the DBP increase was not significantly affected by the drug. These findings partially contrast with those reported with other beta blockers, particularly the non-~l-selective ones, which have been shown to attenuate the HR but not the BP increase due to smoking [4-9]. The effects of acute celiprolol administration on the cardiovascular responses to smoking are probably due to its peculiar pharmacological properties. Celiprolol combines ~l-antagonist and ~2-agonist activity and is provided with a nonadrenergic vasodilating action and a mild a2-adrenoceptor blocking influence [11,12]. In addition to all cardiac changes usually induced by beta blockade, these properties should lead to vasodilation. Probably due to such a vasodilating effect, celiprolol seems to counteract the pressor effect of cigarette smoking. Another point to be considered is the fact that some beta blockers are metabolized in the liver on first pass after absorption; as cigarette smoking stimulates first-pass metabolism, for a given dose the plasma concentration has been reported to reach only half that in nonsmokers, with consequent less effective BP control in smokers [15]. This problem may not occur with celiprolol, which is not metabolized in the liver. In conclusion, due to its capacity to attenuate the",

        "abstrak":"ABSTRACT The prevalence of active drug efflux pump and porin alterations was investigated in Turkish nosocomial strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibiting a multidrug-resistant phenotype. MICs of various antibiotics, including quinolones, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and β-lactams, for those strains were determined either with or without the efflux pump inhibitor phenylalanine arginine β-naphthylamide (PAβN). Thirty-nine percent of the strains exhibited a PAβN-modulated resistance for quinolones, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. In these strains, a significant increase of chloramphenicol accumulation was gained in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor PAβN or with the energy uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Moreover, high-level expression of the membrane fusion protein AcrA, which was immunodetected in most of those isolates, suggests that the AcrAB\/TolC efflux machinery contributed to their antibiotic resistance. Studies of K. pneumoniae porins indicated that the majority of the strains, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers and efflux-positive ones, presented an alteration in their sorbitol-sensitive porin (OmpK35) expression. This is the first report showing the prominent role of active drug efflux in the antibiotic resistance of nosocomial K. pneumoniae strains from Turkey.",

When the process happens between two parties, the client and the server, a binding agreement or contract is defined specifying the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as products\/services to be delivered, the deadlines and the cost of services. The goal of QoS is to select the appropriate web services for the customers achieve their goals. The existing service applications pretend to be a self-contained unit of functionalities that requests and retrieve a qualified service using service oriented architecture. But they face difficulties in identifying the right quality of a service based on functionality. Hence the major factor in QoS specification is QoS modeling, which involves the task of identifying the factors suitable for a functional requirement. QoS-aware service composition significantly affects the quality of a composite service and hence enormous research has been performed in this area. However, existing methods are restricted to predefined workflows, which can sustain the limitations. The limitations include the lack of guarantee for the optimality on overall QoS, satisfaction of customers and the completeness of finding a composite service solution. The proposed approach uses an Aggregated Quantified Response time Matrix Formulation (ARMF) methodology. The ARMF predicts the unknown QoS values by implementing two algorithms, the Aggregated Quantified Matrix Formulation (AQMF) Technique and the Optimal Incremental Multi-Attributes property Filtering (OIMF). It provides the user-response matrix where every entry in the matrix depicts the QoS value of the service opted by the user. The experimental results show that the proposed approach largely outperforms the existing techniques in terms of quality and efficiency required for the customer services.",

It is abundant and widespread in Tasmania, following a successful introduction in the mid-1850s. Sugar gliders are almost exclusively arboreal and seldom venture to the forest floor. Their diet is mainly invertebrates, though the sugary sap from trees of the genus Eucalyptus and the nectar and pollen from Banksia are eagerly sought during winter. Highly social mammals, sugar gliders nest and breed in tree holes in small colonies of about 6 to 10 individuals (Suckling 1984). While group structure is not fully understood it is usual for more than ore fully mature male to be present. In Tasmania they breed once each year, mating in the winter (July to early September) and give birth after a gestation of about 16 days. A single young, or occasionally twins, remain in the pouch attached to a teat for a further two months. It is possible for females to carry a second litter but this usually occurs only when the first has been lost (Stoddart and Bradley, in press).",

The advantage of large inflorescences in terms of attractiveness was larger for racemes and umbels than for panicles, whereas the effect of inter-inflorescence distance on the number of successive probes was smaller for racemes than for panicles and umbels. The number of flowers probed per visit increased almost proportionally with display size when fewer flowers were empty, whereas the number increased less when many flowers were empty.

        "abstrak":"BACKGROUND Fibrinogen plays a key role in hemostasis and is the first coagulation factor to reach critical levels in bleeding patients. Current European guidelines on the management of traumatic or perioperative bleeding recommend fibrinogen supplementation at specific threshold levels. Whole blood viscoelastic tests provide fast evaluation of fibrin deficits. Fast measurement of plasma fibrinogen concentration is not yet available. We investigated a method to rapidly determine whole blood fibrinogen concentration using standard Clauss assays and a steel ball coagulometer and provide an estimate of the “plasma-equivalent” fibrinogen concentration within minutes by adjustment of the measured whole blood fibrinogen concentration with a quickly measureable hemoglobin-derived hematocrit. METHODS The feasibility of this approach was tested with a Clauss assay using multiple porcine fresh blood samples obtained during in vivo bleeding, hemodilution, and after treatment with hemostatic therapy. Two different Clauss assays were then tested using multiple human volunteers’ blood samples diluted in vitro and supplemented with fibrinogen concentrate. Comparative measurements with fibrin-based thromboelastometry tests were performed. RESULTS Regression and Bland-Altman analyses of derived “plasma-equivalent” fibrinogen and measured plasma fibrinogen concentration was excellent in porcine and human blood samples, especially in the ranges relevant to traumatic or perioperative bleeding. CONCLUSION Fast whole blood fibrinogen measurements could be considered as an alternative to plasma fibrinogen measurement for acute bleeding management in trauma and perioperative care settings. Further studies are needed to prove this concept and determine the turnaround times for its clinical application in emergency departments and operating theaters.",

A chronology of events leading to the cloning of the NF1 gene is offered as a summary of modern gene hunting techniques. The gene was identified by its location rather than its function using positional cloning. Linkage analysis, based on DNA polymorphisms, is already available for prenatal and presymptomatic testing. This technique works only in cases when affected family members are available and is useless in spontaneous cases. The complete NF1 gene is huge, has a large number of exons, and is approximately 240,000 base pairs long. Its large size is consistent with the very high spontaneous mutation rate. The NF1 gene is evolutionarily conserved and expressed ubiquitously, not just in neural crest derivatives. Functional and structural homology with GAP (GTP [guanosine triphosphate]ase-activating protein) has been described. The GAP controls (or is controlled by) the ras oncogene. Aberration of ras function, which plays a fundamental role in growth, development, and differentiation, may play a role in the NF1 phenotype.

The current model is a modification of a previous integro-differential model also based in a discretization of the Eshelby one. It has been modified to perform the calculations starting from an integral equation on strain tensor instead of an integro-differential equation on displacements. It allows us, through the use of a novel convergence criterion, to find the solution for the elastoplastic field in the general case of ellipsoidal particles under thermal and mechanical loads. Both modifications greatly improve the ability of the model to handle composites with high ratios between matrix and inclusion shear moduli. The formulation is applied to a model case of Al matrix reinforced with SiC round particles. Both matrix and particles are considered elastic and thermally isotropic. The particle behavior is purely elastic and the matrix flows when it reaches an isotropic yield stress. It is found that the results agree with previous finite element method (FEM) calculations and the method allows us to study local plastic relaxation when mechanical load is below the matrix macroscopic yield stress.",

Early diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in Computed Tomography (CT) chest scans provides an opportunity for designing effective treatment and making financial and care plans. In this paper, we consider the problem of diagnostic classification between benign and malignant lung nodules in CT images, which aims to learn a direct mapping from 3D images to class labels. To achieve this goal, four two-pathway Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are proposed, including a basic 3D CNN, a novel multi-output network, a 3D DenseNet, and an augmented 3D DenseNet with multi-outputs. These four networks are evaluated on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset and outperform most existing methods. In particular, the 3D multi-output DenseNet (MoDenseNet) achieves the state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the task of end-to-end lung nodule diagnosis. In addition, the networks pretrained on the LIDC-IDRI dataset can be further extended to handle smaller datasets using transfer learning.

It is a decorated modification of the Gaussian core model, in which particles possess a spectrum of thermally activated internal states. Excitation leads to a change in a particle’s Gaussian interaction parameters, and this can result in a spatially periodic crystal possessing a higher entropy than the fluid with which it coexists. Numerical solution of the model, using integral equations and the hypernetted chain closure for the fluid phase, and the Einstein model for the solid phases, identifies two types of inverse melting. One mimics the behavior of the helium isotopes, for which the higher-entropy crystal is denser than the liquid. The other corresponds to in...",

Models of this kind are well developed for cases where individuals interfere with each other's ability to forage effectively by reducing intake rate at high density, or alternatively where there is no direct interaction between conspecifics, However, although the movement of geese within and between flocks is affected by dominance interactions, they do not show classical interference. These models therefore cannot adequately describe the foraging dynamics of flocking geese. This paper describes the development of a novel approach to this problem, based on a trade-off between the vigilance benefits and the depletion costs of feeding in larger flocks. The need for this development is discussed in relation to the fundamental characteristics of goose flocks which distinguish them from other foraging systems. The approach is placed in the context of a broader project modelling the year-round dynamics of the Svalbard barnacle goose population from the perspective of individual behaviour.",

Average occurrence rates were used as a reference. The percentage changes vary significantly depending on these subdivisions. For example for very high GA the inverse association is recorded by a change of −33% for Rz ≥ 150, and −10% for Rz < 50. Using data for 9 years for the equatorial station, Huancayo, these measurements of ESF, which indicate the presence of TIDs, have also been investigated by somewhat similar analyses. Additional parameters were used which involved the local times of GA, with the ESF being examined separately for occurrence pre-midnight (PM) and after-midnight (AM). Again the negative changes were most pronounced for high GA in Rz-max years (−21%). This result is for PM ESF for GA at a local time of 1700. There were increased ESF levels (+31%) for AM ESF in Rz-min years for high GA around 2300 LT. This additional knowledge of the influence of GA on ESF occurrence involving not only percentage changes, but these values for a range of parameter levels, may be useful if ever short-term forecasts are needed.

Employing a comparative framework based on Arend Lijphart’s celebrated analysis of democratic regime characteristics, I find that many of the core national institutions of democracy have proven extremely resilient in the face of any erosive effects of integration. The content of politics may have changed in response to integration, but not the containers, it would seem.

The aims of this research were to evaluate the effects of this resin (Sv resin) on bacterial populations and to determine the impact of its primary volatile components on bioactivity. The impact of sample treatment on chemical composition of Sv resin was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) coupled with principal component analysis. The presence and concentration of volatiles in lyophilized resin were determined using gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry (GC\/MS). Changes in bacterial population counts due to treatment with resin or its primary volatile components were monitored. Autoclaving of the samples did not affect the FTIR spectra of Sv resin; however, lyophilization altered spectra, mainly in the CH and C=O regions. Three primary bioactive compounds that constituted >90% of volatiles (1R-α-pinene, tricyclene, and β-pinene) were identified in Sv resin. Autoclaved resin impacted bacterial growth. The resin was stimulatory for some plant and foodborne pathogens (Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. syringae, and Xanthomonas perforans) and antimicrobial for others (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Erwinia amylovora). Treatment with either 1R-α-pinene or β-pinene reduced B. cereus population growth less than did autoclaved resin.

An Arrhenius plot of the line width decreases linearly with decreasing temperature over the temperature range 0–38.5 °C. This behavior indicates that the lifetime of the enzyme-zinc-chloride complex is the dominating relaxation time of the system. The value of koff at pH 6.46 and 8.59 at 25 °C is 1 × 106 sec−1 and 7.3 × 105 sec−1, respectively. Using a value of Ki of 0.2 m values for kon are 5 × 106 m −1 sec−1 and 3.7 × 106 m −1 sec−1. These values are somewhat lower than that for aqueous zinc ion and may be related to the hindered nature of the zinc site in the enzyme. The energy of activation obtained for the chloride exchange process is 3.6 kcal\/mole. Anion competitive binding studies for bovine carbonic anhydrase have also been made for a number of monovalent anions. KI values obtained by analysis of chloride line broadening are in agreement with those determined kinetically.

The bacterial responses to the presence of nanosilver usually vary depending on the concentration of nanosilver particles, exposure time and the bacterial physiological stage. Since bacterial anabolism dependents upon a stoichiometric ratio of carbon and inorganic elements (nutrients), the macronutrient ratio, i.e. carbon to nitrogen ratio (C\/N) thus plays an important role of bacterial responses to the exposure of nanosilver. This study investigated the responses of Escherichia coli to the exposure of nanosilver under variable growth conditions. It was discovered that E. coli grown under different growth conditions had different responses to the presence of nanosilver. E. coli had least resistance to the toxicity of nanosilver when cultured under carbon-limited conditions. However, the presence of rhamnolipid, a commonly utilized biosurfactant for soil remediation increased the resistance of E. coli to nanosilver. The transport of E. coli cultured under carbon-limited conditions was further studied in silica sand columns. E. coli adsorption in silica sand increased when cultured in the presence of nanosilver.

In this paper the feasibility of three different vibration absorbers is discussed when reducing transient vibrations originating from sudden load changes. The classical linear absorber is compared to two nonlinear ones, one with a cubic spring (known as the nonlinear energy sink or NES) and one with a combination of a linear and a cubic spring (a Duffing type absorber). Both nonlinear absorbers succeed in achieving a multimodal vibration reduction, whereas the linear absorber can only mitigate a single vibration mode. The most important reduction is however obtained in the initial phase where the energy of one vibration mode is decreased through a beating phenomenon. A much slower energy reduction of the remaining vibration modes takes place after this initial phase. As a result, both the NES and the Duffing type absorber still need to be tuned to the most important mode, despite their ability to mitigate multiple modes.",

There has been increased interest in the use of chemotherapy for young children, but little information concerning the long-term efficacy of such treatment. Seventy-eight children with a mean age of 3 years (range 3 months-16 years) who had newly diagnosed, progressive low-grade gliomas were treated with combined carboplatin and vincristine chemotherapy. The patients were followed for a median of 30 months from diagnosis, with 31 patients followed for more than 3 years. Fifty-eight children had diencephalic tumors, 12 had brainstem gliomas, and three had diffuse leptomeningeal gliomas. Forty-four (56%) of 78 patients showed an objective response to treatment. Progression-free survival rates were 75 +\/- 6% at 2 years and 68 +\/- 7% at 3 years. There was no statistical difference in progression-free survival rates between children with neurofibromatosis Type 1 and those without the disease (2-year, progression-free survival 79 +\/- 11% vs. 75 +\/- 6%, respectively). The histological subtype of the tumor, its location, and its maximum response to chemotherapy did not have an impact on the duration of disease control. The only significant prognostic factor was age: children 5 years old or younger at the time of treatment had a 3-year progression-free survival rate of 74 +\/- 7% compared with a rate of 39 +\/- 21% in older children (p < 0.01).

        "abstrak":"Abstract Critical experiments using an insertion zone with FLiBe salt performed at the LR-0 reactor at Research Centre Řež (RC Řež) have been compared to application models for solid-fueled, fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR) and liquid-fueled molten salt reactor (MSR) concepts using sensitivity and uncertainty (S\/U) analysis techniques. These experiments support FHR and MSR advanced reactor concepts by informing on neutron spectral effects and nuclear data uncertainties related to fluoride salts. The FLiBe salt in the LR-0 experiments is from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Molten Salt Reactor Experiment and is enriched to greater than 99.99% 7Li. This work is part of a broader collaboration between the United States and the Czech Republic on MSR and FHR technology. Results from the S\/U analyses for FHR and MSR models indicated the most significant potential source of eigenvalue bias due to nuclear data within the FLiBe salt is radiative capture in 7Li. Other smaller but potentially significant contributions come from 19F, 6Li, and other 7Li reactions. Similarity comparisons of the RC Řež LR-0 experiments and FHR and MSR application models indicate that the LR-0 FLiBe experiments could be useful as candidate benchmarks for low-enriched uranium–fueled application models. However, sensitivity differences observed included both spectral effects, due to the LR-0 reactor being moderated by water instead of graphite and fluoride salt, and sensitivity magnitude effects driven by the amount of FLiBe inserted and its location. New experiments with refined designs to increase the volume and importance of salt in the system could provide improved data. Results also demonstrate that salt systems using thorium and\/or 233U fuel will require additional experiments with relevant driver fuels. Increased contributions from the graphite moderator and 19F and covariance between reactions such as 233U fission and 233U radiative capture indicate higher uncertainty contributions from the salt and significant differences in contributions from the fuel species due to underlying uncertainties in their nuclear data.",

When the five Central Asian republics of the USSR became independent in 1991, they soon encountered a proactive engagement of Japanese diplomacy toward them. Besides boosting bilateral assistance and economic ties, official Tokyo has vigorously promoted the Central Asian states’ eligibility in many international financial institutions and provided extensive advice on reform policies. Both Japanese and Central Asian officials shared a preference for gradualism in economic reforms as a popular approach alternative to the Western neoliberalism in Central Asian countries, although the extent of embracing gradualism varied upon individual republics and advising officials. Spurred by the failures of the Washington consensus and financial crises of the 1990s, Central Asian gradualism can be regarded as an early precursor attempt at post-neoliberalism.",

The growth of wind power production in the electricity portfolio is striving to meet ambitious targets set, for example by the EU, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020. Huge investments are now being made in new offshore wind farms around UK coastal waters that will have a major impact on the GB electrical supply. Representations of the UK wind field in syntheses which capture the inherent structure and correlations between different locations including offshore sites are required. Here, Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are presented and extended in a novel way to incorporate offshore time series from a pan-European meteorological model called COSMO, with onshore wind speeds from the MIDAS dataset provided by the British Atmospheric Data Centre. Forecasting ability onshore is shown to be improved with the inclusion of the offshore sites with improvements of up to 25% in RMS error at 6 h ahead. In addition, the VAR model is used to synthesise time series of wind at each offshore site, which are then used to estimate wind farm capacity factors at the sites in question. These are then compared with estimates of capacity factors derived from the work of Hawkins et al. (2011). A good degree of agreement is established indicating that this synthesis tool should be useful in power system impact studies.",

The beneficial effects of relaxin peptide treatment were demonstrated in clinically relevant animal models of liver fibrosis. However, the use of relaxin is problematic because of a short half‐life. The aim of this study was to test the therapeutic effects of recently identified small molecule agonists of the human relaxin receptor, relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1). The lead compound of this series, ML290, was selected based on its effects on the expression of fibrosis‐related genes in primary human stellate cells. RNA sequencing analysis of TGF‐β1–activated LX‐2 cells showed that ML290 treatment primarily affected extracellular matrix remodeling and cytokine signaling, with expression profiles indicating an antifibrotic effect of ML290. ML290 treatment in human liver organoids with LPS‐induced fibrotic phenotype resulted in a significant reduction of type I collagen. The pharmacokinetics of ML290 in mice demonstrated its high stability in vivo, as evidenced by the sustained concentrations of compound in the liver. In mice expressing human RXFP1 gene treated with carbon tetrachloride, ML290 significantly reduced collagen content, α‐smooth muscle actin expression, and cell proliferation around portal ducts.

In this method instead of one single parameter varying controller, multiple fixed parameter controllers pertaining to different operation regimes are utilized.

This methodology although promising needs further systematic analysis regarding the determination of the minimum number of controllers required and their corresponding locations (in the uncertain parameter space) to address stability and performance issues. This research work presents the basics of Adaptive Control with Multiple Models, introduces the problem of optimal problem distribution of the multiple models, and finally demonstrates a novel optimization based methodology to determine the number of controllers and their optimal locations for a given uncertainty.",

Albizia zygia (DC) Macbride is an indigenous West African tree species used to provide shade for cocoa. Its potential for the amelioration of degraded cocoa soils is being studied. The effects of the duration of soaking seeds in 98% concentrated sulphuric acid and of substrate acidity on its germination and early root growth are presented. Scarifying seeds for five minutes, the shortest duration trial, in acid elicited maximum germination response—99% germination compared to 7% without acid scarification. Seeds germinated at all the pH levels tested (pH 3.5 to 6.5), with no significant differences in percent germination among treatments in the pH range of 4.5 to 6.0. Radicle length was also not affected by pH in the range of pH 4.0 to 6.0. The results indicate that germination and early root growth in A. zygia are relatively tolerant of low pH soils. These results support the species as a possible candidate for the amelioration of degraded cocoa soils in Ghana.",

Firstly, neither learners nor tutors, who are used to more traditional methods of teaching, know exactly what to expect from PBL or how to behave appropriately within their new roles. Secondly, these problems are compounded by having to interact within a socially unfamiliar computer-based learning environment. We frame these difficulties in terms of schema theory which suggests that people behave and know what to expect from situations according to mentally represented scripts describing the typical course of events. We apply computational descriptions of these scripts, i.e. PBL-protocols, which guide and control social interaction in virtual PBL groups according to (a) the phase of the learning process and (b) the specific roles of tutor, learner and expert; three roles which are typically distinguished in the problem-based learning method. The PBL-protocols restrict the type of contributions allowed for each role type for each phase of the PBL learning process. We describe the implementation of the PBL- protocols in the CROCODILE virtual learning environment, and discuss results and implications of an early pilot study.",

        "abstrak":"Tourism is a world of sensations, of emotions. In turn, heritage (tangible and intangible) is an essential resource for the configuration of a tourist destination; a generator of experiences based on the sensations and emotions that tourists feel when interacting with that heritage. In this process, culture (from its intangible dimension) is a key element, and depending on the type of destination, the architectural and natural heritage (the tangible dimension) will also represent unique resources. We are speaking, therefore, of perceptions of a particular reality – whether these are ex-ante or ex-post perceptions – of the mental representations of individuals or ‘ways of seeing the world’, as one of the authors of the book puts it. Sometimes these are rather stereotyped but they are always influenced by the communication campaigns mounted by tourism-promotion organisations, among others, in the mass media, either through traditional channels such as TV or in new media such as the Internet. Another critical variable comes into play here in strategic and marketing studies: expectations. The prior expectations of tourists that are created and fed by this communication route have a major impact on the degree of final satisfaction with the experience, depending on whether those expectations are fulfilled, exceeded or disappointed. We are thus dealing with the process of creation of a destination’s image in our mind, as well, of course, as our social networks and the opinions (especially, the experiences) of others play an increasingly important part in this process. Collectively, this process determines the so-called corporate reputation of the companies and other organisations involved. This work offers many key insights into this context. Although they may not be specifically orientated to this topic, those who study the creation and impact of image will find much that is valuable in this book. Those representations in which visual perceptions perhaps play the dominant role get to be influenced by the experiences that each tourist or tripper shares with others; experiences that are, in turn, influenced by the trilogy of factors: ‘people, place and past’, presented in the third chapter. In fact, a fourth factor, the ‘present’, could be added as another significant element in the configuration of these representations. This trilogy, perhaps with one or more additions, leads us to another fundamental concept: authenticity. This concept, which is also rather complex due to its multidimensionality, is dealt with in Chapter 9, with some very revealing cases. Authenticity is increasingly important because among the motivations of the tourists, the search for authentic experiences is very much coming to the fore. The problem is in defining what is understood by an authentic experience.",

A diploid chromosome number (2n=40) was found in three of five PD tumors, with numbers in the triploid to tetraploid range in the other two. Some PI tumors were diploid, but most were aneuploid (8 of 12 tumors). The most frequent alterations found in PD and PI tumors were gains of chromosomes 3, 4, and 6 and losses of chromosomes 16 and X. Chromosomes 4 and 7 were involved in translocations in three of the four tumor families studied. single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis revealed a point mutation on the Trp53 gene in one of the PD tumors; this showed a stable diploid karyotype, suggesting that mutated Trp53 is not uniquely involved in chromosome instability. We have shown that hormone independence may be acquired without changes in ploidy, suggesting that the increase in ploidy is favored by successive transplantation. In our model, diploid tumors responded to hormone treatment but aneuploid tumors were either responsive or not.",

Glass ceramics containing CaF 2 nanocrystals were prepared by heat treating the glass samples at a temperature in the range of 620–680 °C. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that the average crystallite size and the lattice constant of CaF 2 nanocrystals increased with the heat treatment temperature increasing. The luminescence spectra showed that the emission intensity of Eu 3+ doped glass ceramics was stronger than that of the glass matrix, and increased with the heat treatment temperature increasing.

Isolated intestinal GLs were positive for T cell receptor (TcR) 1-N24 (gamma delta) and CD8 alpha, and negative for WC1-N3 and WC1-N4. Cryostat sections of ileum revealed preferential intraepithelial distribution of both TcR1-N24+ cells and CD8+ cells. WC1-N3+ and WC1-N4+ cells were rarely seen in the epithelium and lamina propria.

This paper examines the unique numbering system the Topps company developed to differentiate among the “royalty of the diamond” from 1956 to 1980. Their system assigned to each card in a set a number that explicitly designated its placement, while implicitly establishing a hierarchical ordering among the players, ostensibly based on performance. It is arguable whether the numbering system Topps developed was based on performance or the ascribed characteristic of race. The results of our work suggest that player performance, not race, was the primary factor in the assignment of “prestigious” card numbers in Topps’ system.",

National estimates reveal high rates of these risk behaviors among high school students. Based on theoretical and empirical evidence, we hypothesized that experiencing teen dating violence (sexual and physical) would mediate the impact of bullying on HIV risk.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were from the 2013 National Youth Behavior Risk Surveillance Survey (YRBSS) among students who answered questions on bullying, TDV, and HIV risk (N = 13,571). The YRBSS is conducted biennially among 9th- to 12th-grade students nationally. We used multiple regression analysis and Hayes' SPSS process macro to examine the 2 study hypotheses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFindings from bivariate analysis suggest an association between bullying and HIV risk. The study also found associations between physical, sexual teen dating violence and HIV risk. Results also indicate that both physical and sexual teen dating violence mediate the association between bullying and HIV risk.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur findings suggest that multidimensional interventions should be developed to reduce the rate of teen dating violence and combat bullying as a preventative method for HIV risk among high school students.",

Although lungs, skin, and peripheral nervous system are the most common sites of involvement, many other organs, including heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract, can be affected. CSS is an eosinophil-mediated disease, but its pathophysiology is not fully known. There are no specific laboratory tests for CSS. The main laboratory characteristics are peripheral blood eosinophilia, elevated serum IgE levels, and the presence of an inflammatory syndrome. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies directed against myeloperoxidase are positive in approximately one-half of patients. The diagnosis of CSS rests on the association of the clinical features of the disease with its histologic hallmarks. The biopsy of affected tissues may show a spectrum of histologic changes, including leukocytoclastic or necrotizing vasculitis, eosinophilic tissue infiltration, vascular and extravascular granulomas. The involved vessels are small arteries, veins, arterioles, venules, and capillaries. Corticosteroids, sometimes in combination with a cytotoxic agent, such as cyclophosphamide, are the most effective treatment of CSS.

        "abstrak":"This article studies the optimal intertemporal allocation of resources devoted to the prevention of deterministic epidemics that admit an endemic steadystate. In a stylized ‘yeoman-farmer’ economy, the dynamics of the optimal prevention depends on the interplay between the epidemiological characteristics of the disease, the labour productivity and the intergenerational equity. A minimal level of labour productivity is shown to be necessary to reduce in the long run the prevalence rate of the epidemic. If this threshold is not reached, the prevention is then at best temporary, simply slowing down the spread of the epidemic disease. However, it may not optimal to undertake temporary prevention. Conversely, if labour productivity is sufficiently high, permanent allocation of resources to prevention is feasible but not necessarily optimal. If it is the case, the prevention monotonically increases with time for low initial prevalence rate, while it is decreasing or hump-shaped otherwise. Finally, paths that yield to the eradication of the epidemic disease are considered. Upon existence, such paths are optimal if the pure discount rate is sufficiently low.

UPLC-qTOP\/MS measurements showed that SSPS observably increased the urinary concentration of genistein and its metabolites in mice. The mice fed with 3% l-carnitine water for 12 weeks experienced a disturbance of the hepatic lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation, which was evidenced by abnormal TC, LDL, RAHFR and MDA levels, unusual AST, ALT, ALP, SOD and GSP-Px activities, and increased IF-1, IF-6 and TNF-α expressions. Interestingly, the co-supplementation of SSPS and genistein was capable of regulating these imbalances more effectively than the administration of SSPS or genistein alone, which was also confirmed by histological observations of the mouse liver. These findings suggest that the co-ingestion of SSPS and genistein is a feasible strategy for improving liver protection in mice.",

However, most existing blind deconvolution methods cannot generate satisfactory results due to their dependence on strong edges, which are sufficient in natural images but not in facial images. In this paper, we represent point spread functions (PSFs) by the linear combination of a set of pre-defined orthogonal PSFs, and similarly, an estimated intrinsic (EI) sharp face image is represented by the linear combination of a set of pre-defined orthogonal face images. In doing so, PSF and EI estimation is simplified to discovering two sets of linear combination coefficients, which are simultaneously found by our proposed coupled learning algorithm. To make our method robust to different types of blurry face images, we generate several candidate PSFs and EIs for a test image, and then, a non-blind deconvolution method is adopted to generate more EIs by those candidate PSFs. Finally, we deploy a blind image quality assessment metric to automatically select the optimal EI. Thorough experiments on the facial recognition technology database, extended Yale face database B, CMU pose, illumination, and expression (PIE) database, and face recognition grand challenge database version 2.0 demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively restores intrinsic sharp face images and, consequently, improves the performance of face recognition.",

In this paper, we propose a new model to measure not only quantitative input but also the quality of the content that has been contributed to a document written collaboratively in Spanish language. Based on topics-modeling techniques, we use an adaptive non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model to extract topics from the content of the document, and grade higher students making those contributions. Using Google documents submitted by students to the academic system of our university as part of their projects, experimental results show that compared to other baseline methods such as edits or words count, our model provide a better approximation to the scores given by human reviewers. Therefore, our model can be used as part of an automatic grading subsystem within the academic system, to provide a baseline score of students' contribution in collaborative documents.

These syndromes are more rare and challenging to classify in clinical practice resulting in a lack of systematic studies on pathophysiology and treatment. We aim at describing clinical features and pathophysiological concepts of typical migraine aura with a focus on cortical spreading depression and differentiation from non‐typical migraine aura. Additionally, we discuss nomenclature and the specifics of migraine aura status, persistent migraine aura, persistent positive visual phenomena, visual snow, and other migrainous visual disturbances. The term migraine with prolonged aura might be a useful bridge between typical aura and persistent aura. Further studies would be necessary to assess whether a return of the classification category eventually helps diagnosing or treating patients more effectively. A practical approach is presented to help the treating physician to assign the correct diagnosis and to choose a medication for treatment that has been successful in case reports of these rare but disabling conditions.",

        "abstrak":"A non-adherence to a strict diurnal or nocturnal activity cycle is prevalent among mammals, including taxa of Lemuridae, but rare among other primates. While non-mutually exclusive ecological hypotheses attempted to explain the evolution of this activity, termed cathemerality, as either an old or a recent phenomenon, the scarcity of systematic data collected over 24-hours limits our potential to explore its proximate and ultimate determinants. Among strepsirrhines, systematic studies involving only two lemurid genera (Eulemur and Lemur) have recorded this activity pattern, while fewer quantitative observations are available for other taxa. If cathemerality could be shown in most members of Lemuridae despite their different ecological adaptations, this would support the hypothesis that this trait is basal and appeared early during lemurid evolution. Here we investigated whether the folivorous southern bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis) exhibits cathemeral activity, and determine which environmental factors influence its pattern. We deployed ten archival tags across four social groups to continuously record activity data over a 15-month period. This allowed us to generate a diurnal\/nocturnal (DN) ratio for each 24-h period and assess their diel activity. Our data suggest that southern bamboo lemurs are cathemeral within Mandena; while climatic factors showed no influence, nocturnal activity increased with greater nocturnal luminance. Despite contrasting dietary niches, visual morphologies, and body sizes between Hapalemur, Eulemur and Lemur, all three exhibit cathemerality and lunarphilia. The close phylogenetic proximity of these lemurids supports this flexible activity pattern as an ancestral trait that likely dates to the origin of the Lemuridae radiation.",

Our previous research showed that application of thiosulfate fertilizers at the soil surface may offer an effective and economical approach to reduce the emission of halogenated fumigants via a chemical remediation process. In this fumigant emission-reduction strategy, volatile 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) reacts with thiosulfate to generate a nonvolatile Bunte salt (thiosulfate derivative of 1,3-D). However, the decomposition of the Bunte salt may be associated with the production of perceptible odors. This study investigated the stability of this reaction product in different environmental media. Hydrolysis experiments demonstrated that the thiosulfate derivative was relatively stable in neutral and moderately acidic aqueous solutions. In contrast, the thiosulfate derivative was readily converted to a dialkyl disulfide via a base hydrolysis process in pH 10 buffer solution. In a strongly acidic solution, a mercaptan and a dialkyl disulfide compound were detected as two primary hydrolysis products. In soil, this initial reaction product underwent a series of biotic conversions to generate several volatile or semivolatile organic sulfur compounds. The formation and distribution of four volatile\/semivolatile products in the air and soil were detected in different soils treated with the thiosulfate derivative of 1,3-D. This study indicated that odors occurring in soil treated with halogenated fumigants and thiosulfate fertilizers might arise from the generation and release of these and other volatile\/semivolatile organic sulfur products. The environmental fate and effects of such volatile\/semivolatile sulfur compounds should be considered in the application of sulfur-containing fertilizers in fumigated fields.",

Ambulatory blood pressure was recorded for a 24-hour period before the start of hormone replacement therapy and again 2 and 6 months later. Analysis of variance was used for data analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHormone replacement therapy by both oral and transdermal routes was associated with slight but nonsignificant drops in mean 24-hour systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure. Daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure (mean +\/- SE) fell significantly (P <.05) and similarly at 2 months in the oral (3.8 +\/- 0.2 mm Hg) and transdermal (4.0 +\/- 0.3 mm Hg) treatment groups. The daytime ambulatory blood pressure remained significantly lower than baseline at 6 months in the oral treatment group (-3.6 +\/- 0.3 mm Hg), whereas the fall at 6 months in the transdermal group (-3.1 +\/- 0.3 mm Hg) was not significant. Mean daytime diastolic ambulatory blood pressure was reduced in both the oral (-1.8 +\/- 0.8 mm Hg) and transdermal (-3.5 +\/- 0.7 mm Hg; P <.05) treatment groups at 2 months but not at 6 months. Nighttime ambulatory blood pressures in both groups remained unaffected by hormone replacement therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSequential combined hormone replacement therapy delivered by both oral and transdermal routes caused significant falls in the daytime ambulatory blood pressure of normotensive postmenopausal women at 2 months of treatment.

        "abstrak":"ABSTRACT The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), ranks as one of the world's most destructive agricultural pests. This pest is also widespread and highly invasive; thus, it is a high priority for pest detection and quarantine programs. Although Mediterranean fruit fly adult and third-instar larvae can usually be identified and distinguished from other species by morphological keys, it is often difficult or impossible to identify or distinguish this species from other tephritids by using material from other stages of development. In such situations, use of a molecular technique known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) would be valuable as a rapid and robust alternative species diagnostic tool. This method uses isothermal conditions and requires only relatively inexpensive equipment. In this study we have developed a simple and rapid procedure that combines a Chelex-based DNA extraction procedure with LAMP to rapidly detect the presence of Mediterranean fruit fly DNA and discriminate it from other species, by using material from different stages of development. Amounts of DNA as little as that recovered from a single egg were shown to be adequate for the analysis, and LAMP itself required only 45 min to complete.",

This means that for most choices of the initial and final states the approximate transition amplitude, as usually defined, does not exist. This difficulty is resolved and an approximate transition amplitude is defined which is a variational estimate of the exact transition amplitude for arbitrary initial and final states. In the Sturmian representation the exchange matrix elements can be calculated more directly by solving a set of coupled differential equations which is somewhat different from the set of equations given by Cheshire (1967). A procedure that does not require storage and interpolation of the matrix elements in order to exploit their time-symmetry is also described.",

        "abstrak":"The object of this study is to define the part played by maternal iron-deficiency anaemia in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency anaemia in infancy, a condition commonly found in Cape Town (Lanzkowsky and McKenzie, 1959; Lanzkowsky, 1959 and 1960a). A number of early reports on the effect of maternal iron-deficiency anaemia on the newborn have indicated that maternal anaemia does not cause anaemia in the infant soon after birth and that the foetus avails itself of maternal blood-forming materials necessary for its own requirement irrespective of the condition of maternal blood (Baar and Stransky, 1928; Strauss, 1933; Strauss and Castle, 1933; Fullerton, 1937; Davidson and Fullerton, 1938). This view has been opposed by Maurer, Greengard and Kluver (1932). Paradoxically, Strean and Gottlieb (1936) found that the greater the maternal anaemia, the greater the foetal polycythaemia. More recently Sisson and Lund (1958), basing the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anaemia on calculation of maternal and infant red cell volume and haemoglobin mass, concluded that infants of anaemic mothers frequently did have an iron-deficiency anaemia. Woodruff and Bridgeforth (1953) and Sturgeon (1959), on the other hand, are at variance with the work of Sisson and Lund and have convincingly shown in large and well-controlled series that there is no difference in the state of iron nutrition in groups of infants born to mothers with various degrees of iron nutrition. Many authors have endorsed the statement that infants born to anaemic mothers become anaemic towards the end of the first year, although scientific evidence supporting this concept is very scanty. Mackay (1931), Abt and Nagel (1932), Neale and Hawksley (1933), Parsons (1933), Strauss (1933, 1935) and Hahn, Carothers, Darby, Martin, Sheppard, Cannon, Beam, Densen, Peterson and McClellan (1951) all favoured the view that maternal",

        "abstrak":"BACKGROUND\nCocaine addiction is a chronic brain disease affecting neurotransmission. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors modulate dopaminergic signaling in the reward system, and muscarinic receptor stimulation can block direct reinforcing effects of cocaine. Here, we tested the hypothesis that specific muscarinic M4 receptor stimulation can attenuate the discriminative stimulus effects and conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine, measures believed to predict the ability of cocaine and cocaine-associated cues to elicit relapse to drug taking.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe tested the M4-selective positive allosteric modulators VU0152100 and VU0467154 in a drug discrimination assay and a conditioned place preference assay, including extinction and reinstatement of place preference. Specificity of the cocaine discrimination effect was verified using knockout mice lacking either M1 or M4 receptors (M1-\/-, M4-\/-). We also replicated previous findings in cocaine-induced locomotor hyperactivity and striatal dopamine microdialysis assays.\n\n\nRESULTS\nVU0152100 attenuated the discriminative stimulus effect of cocaine in wild-type mice and M1-\/- mice, but not in M4-\/- mice, without affecting rates of responding. As previously shown with VU0152100, VU0467154 almost eliminated cocaine-induced hyperactivity and striatal dopamine efflux. VU0467154 failed to attenuate acquisition of cocaine-conditioned place preference, but facilitated extinction and prevented reinstatement of the conditioned place preference.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings further support the notion that M4 receptors are promising targets for the treatment of cocaine addiction, by showing that results can be replicated using distinct ligands, and that in addition to blocking reinforcing effects of cocaine relevant to ongoing drug taking, M4 positive allosteric modulators can also attenuate subjective and conditioned effects relevant to relapse.",

A snapshot of the MHD model is then used as an initial and boundary condition for a particle-in-cell simulation, using up to half a billion cells and over 20 billion charged particles. Particle acceleration occurs mainly in the reconnection current sheet, with accelerated electrons displaying a power law in the energy probability distribution with an index of around –1.5.

Several cloud service providers have offered different capabilities for a variety of market segments over the past few years. The most important aspects of cloud computing are resource scheduling, performance measures, and user requests. Sluggish access to data, applications, and web pages spoils employees and customers alike, as well as cause application crashes and data losses. In this paper, the authors propose an analytical queuing model for performance evaluation of cloud server farms for processing bulk data. Some important performance measures such as mean number of tasks in the queue, blocking probability, and probability of immediate service, and waiting-time distribution in the system have also been discussed. Finally, a variety of numerical results showing the effect of model parameters on key performance measures are presented.

Virtualization offers both flexibility and security through custom user images and user isolation. Due to commercial interests, a cloud provider normally has a proprietorship where a user makes an image that only runs on the provider’s site. Many cross-site technologies applied in grid computing can easily be adopted by cloud computing. The actual configuration and management of cloud computing differs from traditional computing paradigms as it is scalable, can be encapsulated as an abstract entity, and the services are dynamically configurable. Cloud Computing infrastructure allows users to achieve more efficient use of their IT hardware and software investments with super-user privileges on-demand. This is accomplished by analyzing the physical barrier inherent in isolated systems, automating the management of the group of the systems as a single entity. Any task request sent to the cloud management system (CMS) is serviced within a suitable service node; after the completion of the service, the task leaves the center. A service node may contain resources such as web servers, database servers, directory servers and others. A service level agreement (SLA) outlines all aspects of cloud service usage and the obligations of both service providers and clients, including various descriptors collectively referred to as Quality of Service (QoS). Cloud computing may be considered as a resource available as a service for virtual data centers. For example, in Amazons S3 Storage Service cloud computing and virtual data centers are not the same (Rittinghouse, & Ransome, 2010). QoS is the criterion which measures the satisfaction of users using the Cloud Computing services. Due to dynamic nature of cloud environments, diversity cloud computing delivers three kinds of services: Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) (Foster, Fidler, Roy, Sander, & Winkler, 2004, Rimal & Eunmi, 2009). These services are available to users in a Pay per-use-on-demand model, which can access shared IT resources like server, data storage, application, network and so on through internet. Iosup et al. (2011) analyzed the performance of cloud computing services for scientific computing workloads. Users of cloud computing services are faced with the problem of transferring large amounts of data across a geographically dispersed network under time and budget constraints. This problem arises because cloud computing services work on the scale of terabyte and are composed of geographically dispersed and distant sites. Cloud partners like to combine large amounts of data, from multiple distributed locations to a single datacenter. There are many reasons to transfer data between sites, for example, users may have to perform initial transfers, cloud service provider migrations, site backups, or user data migrations. Furthermore to perform their data transfers within a certain time deadline and to minimize the cost of the transfer. In particular, the challenge of reducing the latency of the transfer, without incurring excessive costs is the bottleneck for cloud users (Chung, 2000). Cloud providers charge their cloud users for bandwidth utilization when the size of data transfer is high, or when the transfers are frequent. A variety of cloud applications require bulk data transfer, such as scientific computing, internet protocol television (IPTV) and real time multimedia steaming, etc. For such applications, data resources provide large amounts of data and users to access the data which is geographically dispersed in most cases. To improve the performance of the system, they must be processed in bulk in accordance to the service level agreement (SLA). In case of IPTV service, it simply relies on the availability of sufficient network and data resource which must be operated within the limitation of time constraints, otherwise the corresponding application requirements may not be guaranteed. Therefore, the reservation and utility optimization of the combined resources become critical issues to guarantee the bulk data transfer in cloud computing. It provides optimized and efficient computing through enhanced collaboration, agility, scalability and availability. 11 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the \"Add to Cart\" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com\/article\/performance-analysis-cloudcomputing-centers\/75116?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology.

A Turing machine $M$, that accepts a string of fixed length $t$ as input, runs for a time not exceeding a fixed value $n$ and is guaranteed to produce a binary output, is given. It's required to find a string $X$ such that $M(X) = 1$ effectively in terms of $t$, $n$, the size of the alphabet of $M$ and the number of states of $M$. The problem is close to the well-known Circuit Satisfiability Problem. The difference from Circuit Satisfiability Problem is that when reduced to Circuit Satisfiability Problem, we get circuits with a rich internal structure (in particular, these are circuits of small Kolmogorov complexity). The proof system, operating with potential proofs of the fact that, for a given machine $M$, the string $X$ does not exist, is provided, its completeness is proved and the algorithm guaranteed to find a proof of the absence of the string $X$ in the case of its actual absence is presented (in the worst case, the algorithm is exponential, but in a wide class of interesting cases it works in polynomial time). We present an algorithm searching for the string $X$, for which its efficiency was neither tested, nor proven, and it may require serious improvement in the future, so it can be regarded as an idea. We also discuss first steps towards solving a more complex problem similar to this one: a Turing machine $M$, that accepts two strings $X$ and $Y$ of fixed length and running for a time that does not exceed a fixed value, is given; it is required to build an algorithm $N$ that builds a string $Y = N(X)$ for any string $X$, such that $M(X, Y) = 1$ (details in the introduction).",

The visualization investigation is conducted to observe the oscillation and circulation flow in the CLPHP. In order to investigate the effects of inclination angles to thermal performance in the ammonia CLPHP, four case tests are studied. The trends of temperature fluctuation and thermal resistance as the input power increases at different inclination angles are highlighted. The results show that it is very easy to start up and circulate for the ammonia CLPHP at an inclining angle. The thermal resistance is low to 0.02 K\/W, presenting that heat fluxes can be transferred from heating section to cooling section very quickly. It is found that the thermal resistance decreases as the inclination angle increases. At the horizontal operation, the ammonia CLPHP can be easy to start up at low input power, but hard to circulate. In this case, once the input power is high, the capillary tube in heating section will be burnt out, leading to worse thermal performance with high thermal resistance.",

Growth rate of the second-largest follicle between Hours 0 and 8 was greater (P < 0.05) in the ablation group than in the controls, and the second largest follicle became dominant in 7 of 7 heifers following ablation of the largest follicle. In Experiment 2, a minimal single injection of a depressant of FSH concentrations (4.4 mL of steroid-reduced follicular fluid) was given when the largest follicle was a mean of 8.4 mm (Hour 0; controls, n = 4; treated, n = 4). An interaction of group and hour (P < 0.005) for FSH concentrations was attributable to an FSH decrease (P < 0.002) by Hour 6 and an increase (P < 0.002) between Hours 9 and 12 in the treated group. The growth rate of the largest follicle between Hours 0 and 12 was less (P < 0.05) in the treated group (0.2 +\/- 0.2 mm\/12 h) than in the control group (1.2 +\/- 0.4 mm\/12 h). The reduced diameter was recorded within 6 h after suppression of FSH concentrations, supporting the hypothesis. Our preferred interpretation is that when the largest follicle reaches a critical diameter of about > or = 8.5 mm, FSH concentrations continue to decrease and become lower than required by the smaller follicles but not the largest follicle. The results further indicate that a close temporal coupling between a change in FSH concentrations and the follicular response could establish the deviation mechanism in < 8 h or before the second largest follicle reaches a similar critical diameter.",

Tambourine radically changes the landscape of traditional closed-domain SNMP monitoring into a multi-domain, multi-user monitoring activity by translating HTTP requests from a huge number of Internet users into adequate SNMP requests to network devices. Implementation of cache in Tambourine is vital to ensure that SNMP traffic is kept at a minimum level to avoid burdening network devices with repetitions of SNMP requests. Existing web cache technology however could not be implemented in Tambourine due to two main reasons (i) SNMP is not a cache-aware protocol, and (ii) the value for several OIDs, such as system uptime, changes in real-time causing stale data if it is cached. To solve these problems, our cache design applies a four-state transition to determine the optimum TTL for each OID. Tambourine also aggregates multiple HTTP requests from the same user into a single SNMP request to further reduce the SNMP traffic. In our experiments where three users used a modified MRTG to generate HTTP requests to Tambourine, our cache design converges to zero staleness ratio after five 5-minute cycles.",

It is thought that most cancer MDR is due to the upregulation of drug efflux proteins, such as MDR1 or BCRP. We previously showed that ecto-phosphatase upregulation can lead to an MDR phenotype and ecto-phosphatase inhibition leads to breakdown of p-glycoprotein-mediated MDR implicating ecto-phosphatase activity as a second component of MDR. The experiments here, tested whether novel ecto-phosphatase inhibitors, added to the media, lowers the minimum inhibitory drug concentration (MIC) of non-drug resistant breast cancer cell lines or lowers the drug resistance of MDR lines. The hypothesis tested is that apyrase and other ecto-phosphatases are potential chemotherapeutic targets for the treatment of MDR cancers. These studies showed that there was no reduction in MIC for non drug resistant or drug resistant breast cancer cell lines. The long-term goal is to provide new tools to fight the growing problem of drug-resistant cancers by targeting drug efflux. Based on these exploratory experiments, it is concluded that ecto phosphatase activity alone is probably not a viable anti MDR target in breast cancer.",

A major limitation of kernel-based methods is their high sensitivity to bandwidth values. Least-squares cross-validation (LSCV) is the recommended default bandwidth selection method in ecological literature and is widely available in home-range software. However, various forms of the LSCV method may perform differently in terms of bias and precision. We used simulations to compare the performance of several LSCV forms, including the commonly used scaling approach, as well as sphering, bivariate score function, and univariate alternatives. We combined 2, 4, or 16 bivariate normal distributions and generated sample sizes of 50 or 150 points from each mixture distribution. We calculated absolute bias in home-range size estimates at contours of 99, 95, 75, 50, and 25%. Using the Volume of Intersection (VI) Index, we examined surface fit between each estimated and true distribution. All LSCV forms generally were better than the reference bandwidth. No LSCV option was uniformly best, but the scaling and sphering approaches were slightly better across all contours. Univariate LSCV was similar to other options at outer contours and in surface fit but performed worse at inner contours and was most inconsistent. Using the global versus largest local minimum was unimportant in our comparisons. Although differences among LSCV options were small, these differences could add to variability of kernel estimates across studies. Further evaluation of \"second generation\" methods (e.g., plug-in approaches) is warranted.",

        "abstrak":"Na MRI of the human kidneys, as was recently developed in our lab, enabled the determination of the corticomedullary sodium gradient, and has been proven sensitive to changes in water homeostatsis in the body (4). Both imaging techniques are able to map these physiological parameters in the various regions of the kidneys at 2-3 mm in-plane spatial resolution, and therefore may lead to new insights regarding the pathogenic processes underlining various renal diseases. This ongoing initial study is aimed at monitoring the modulations in renal oxygenation levels and in the corticomedullary sodium gradient along the progression of various types of renal failure, investigating the possible correlation between these two parameters, and determining whether the pathophysiological patterns observed are diffuse or focal in presentation. Methods Subjects: MR studies were performed on 5 patients and 1 healthy volunteer so far. Three of the patients had transplanted kidneys, two of them with chronic renal failure (CRF) and 1 with normal renal function, and the other 2 patients had CRF of their intact kidneys. Data acquisition: MRI scans were performed on a 3.0 T scanner (Signa LX, General Electric, Waukesha, WI). The subjects lay supine and entered the magnet with their feet first. The imaging protocol included two parts: Part I – Anatomical imaging and BOLD, using a torso array 8-channel coil: 1) Fast 3D SPGR (LAVA) with TR\/TE=4\/1.8 ms, flip angle=10°, FOV=40 cm, slice thickness=5 mm, matrix=256x192, 0.8 phase FOV sampled. 2) FGRE in\/out of phase, 2D, TR=250 ms, flip angle=70°, FOV=40 cm, slice thickness=5 mm, slice spacing=0, matrix=320x160, 0.9 phase FOV sampled. 3) BOLD imaging using a 3D multiple GRE sequence, with an echo train of 8 echoes, TE’s ranging from 2 to 23 ms, TR=25.3, flip angle=10°, BW=83.3 KHz, FOV=40x40x50 cm, slice thickness=5 mm (10 slices prescribed, 6 are eventually reconstructed), matrix=256x160, 0.7x0.7 phase FOV sampled, acq. time=23 sec. The sequence was supplied by GE, in collaboration with Pottumarthy V. Prasad, PhD, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois. Part II – Reference proton images (body coil) followed by 23 Na imaging of the kidney using a sodium surface coil: 1) FGRE in\/out of phase, 2D, TR=250 ms, flip angle=70°, FOV=40 cm, slice thickness=15 mm, slice spacing=0, matrix=320x160, 0.8 phase FOV sampled. 2) 23 Na MRI using a 3D-GRE sequence modified for multinuclear imaging, with FOV=38×38×24 cm, matrix size=128×128×16, TE\/TR =1.8\/30 ms, 24 averages, acquisition time=24 min. The short TE was achieved by applying a 66% partial Fourier echo, along with a hard, non-slice selective, 300 sec RF excitation pulse. All scans were prescribed to acquire coronal images of intact kidneys or sagittal images of transplanted kidneys. In each part the scans were prescribed with matched slice locations. All scans except for the 23 Na MRI were acquired during breathholds. Data processing: The anatomical images were evaluated for kidneys size, morphological findings and corticomedullary differentiation. The BOLD data was processed off-line using the freeware ImageJ (5) to fit each pixel intensity curve to an exponential signal decay. The resulting T2* maps were converted to pixel-by-pixel R2* maps (R2*=1\/T2*). The quality of fit (r 2",

Unlike AC-DBDs, the nanosecond pulse driven DBD plasma actuator transfers very little momentum to the neutral air, but generates compression waves similar to localized arc filament plasma actuators. A complex pattern of quasi-planar and spherical compression waves is observed in still air. Measurements suggest that some of these compression waves are generated by discharge filaments that remain fairly reproducible pulse-to-pulse. The device performs as an active trip at high Re pre-stall angles of attack and provides perturbations that generate coherent spanwise vortices at post-stall. These coherent structures entrain freestream momentum thereby reattaching the normally separated flow to the suction surface of the airfoil. Coherent structures are identified at all tested frequencies, but values of F(subponent c, exponent +)=4-6 are most effective for control. Such devices which are believed to function through thermal effects could be an alternative to AC-DBD plasmas that rely on momentum addition.",

In infants with suspected neonatal sepsis, two CRP measurements 24 h apart that are <10 mg\/l are useful in excluding sepsis.",

These revisions challenge the presumption of the West’s centrality in academic research questions by complicating traditional Western comparative methods, models, and theories that produce\/d limited West-centric views. Within WGS more specifically, the transnational turn has led directly to interrogations and re-theorizations of what constitutes feminism, who the feminist subject is, whether universal gender oppression and universal patriarchy are viable conceptual models, and whether certain feminist research methods are liberatory, or, in fact, deeply implicated in uneven power relations. Initially, women of color courses addressed the absence of race as a crucial factor in considerations of gender within WGS (Moallem); since the 1990s, transnational inquiries entered the curriculum to introduce the “non-West” as yet another epistemological corrective to feminist inquiries of race that were, up to then, West-centric, as we see in the case of women of color inquiries. However, just as “women of color” came to be associated with nonwhite women5— not a stretch given the identity political history of the term in the U.S.—transnational scholarship, too, has come to be explicitly and implicitly marked as “race” research, and transnational women faculty6 as “women of color” faculty.

Results were analyzed with a 2-tailed z test of proportional difference at the 95% confidence level.\n\n\nResults\nOf 650 preceptors contacted, 177 responded and were included in the final analysis (27%). Survey item reliability was high (Cronbach α=0.96). A majority of preceptors (59% to 71%) considered TUCOM students \"similar\" to other medical students for each behavior. A majority of preceptors (107 [60%]) shared a definition of empathy with one another and with the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine. Approximately 39% of preceptors rated TUCOM students \"better\" or \"advanced\" for \"displays of empathy\" compared with approximately 30% of preceptors who rated students as better or advanced across all 10 behaviors. Preceptors who shared a definition of empathy rated TUCOM students as better or advanced at a significantly higher rate for \"displays of empathy\" (z=1.982, P<.05) compared with preceptors who did not share a definition (n=70). Osteopathic preceptors (n=67) rated TUCOM students significantly higher on \"displays of empathy\" (z=2.82, P<.05) and \"clear and effective communication to patients, families and co-workers\" (z=2.83, P<.01) than did allopathic preceptors. No significant differences were found based on number of years as a preceptor or on the combination of types of students the preceptor taught.\n\n\nConclusion\nMost clinical preceptors shared a definition of empathy, and they were able to observe and rate displays of it in clerkship students.

        "abstrak":"Sungun mine is the largest open-cast copper mine in northwest of Iran and is in the primary stages of extraction. The influence of mining activity on the quality of regional groundwater has been taken in to consideration in this study. Accordingly, sampling was done from 22 springs in the study area. The concentrations of major anions and cations as well as Al, Cu, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Zn were determined for all 22 spring samples in mid-August 2005. The results showed that the concentrations of most of these elements were below the USA Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits; however, Al and Fe concentrations are considered to be more than limits in a couple of samples. Despite the fact that geological formations are highly weathered and fractured, the dissolution of minerals within the study area is low. This may be justified by the relatively high alkalinity of local underground water which keeps metals in solid phase and does not let them enter dissolved phase. Additionally, this may be attributed to the high velocity of groundwater flows, which do not give enough time for minerals to dissolve. Correlation coefficients among water chemistry components were determined and the weighted-pair group method was chosen for cluster analysis. Accordingly, high correlation among Al, Fe and Cr, Cd ,and Cu, sodium absorption ratio (SAR) and Na as well as total hardness (TH), Ca, and Mg were observed. The chemical characteristics of water compositions on the basis of major ion concentrations were evaluated on a Schoeller and Piper diagram. Accordingly, the dominant type of water in the region is considered to be Ca-HCO3 (calcium-bicarbonate type). However, this type of water is also rich in Na, K, and especially Mg. Regarding Schoeller diagram, the current status of local underground water is good for drinking purposes. By commencing mining excavation with designed capacity in near future, the minerals will come into contact with air and water resulting in dissolution, especially in ponds, which, in turn, will increase the concentration of toxic metals in groundwater. Considering future uses of this water including for drinking, irrigation, industrial purposes, etc., precautions must be taken in to consideration.",

Where the ion intensity was great enough, the kinetic energy of the ion was measured over the greater part of the electron energy of the resonance. In most instances the kinetic energy of the ion increased linearly with electron energy over the range of the resonance. Extrapolation to zero kinetic energy release give the electron energy corresponding to the heat of the dissociation reaction. The kinetic energy released in the formation of F2− and Cl2− was only slightly greater than that predicted by the quasi-equilibrium theory, as would be expected from the fact that the molecule had to change its configuration during dissociation. Essentially all the excess energy was released in translation when SO2F− was formed. The ions F− from SO2F2 and Cl− from SO2Cl2 are formed in two separate resonances, and the kinetic energy lines extrapolate to thermal appearance potentials (ΔHr) corresponding to the formation of SO2 and the halogen atom.

        "tahun_terbit":2016,
        "abstrak":"Growth of intact axons of noninjured neurons, often termed collateral sprouting, contributes to both adaptive and pathological plasticity in the adult nervous system, but the intracellular factors controlling this growth are largely unknown. An automated functional assay of genes regulated in sensory neurons from the rat in vivo spared dermatome model of collateral sprouting identified the adaptor protein CD2-associated protein (CD2AP; human CMS) as a positive regulator of axon growth. In non-neuronal cells, CD2AP, like other adaptor proteins, functions to selectively control the spatial\/temporal assembly of multiprotein complexes that transmit intracellular signals. Although CD2AP polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, its role in axon growth is unknown. Assessments of neurite arbor structure in vitro revealed CD2AP overexpression, and siRNA-mediated knockdown, modulated (1) neurite length, (2) neurite complexity, and (3) growth cone filopodia number, in accordance with CD2AP expression levels. We show, for the first time, that CD2AP forms a novel multiprotein complex with the NGF receptor TrkA and the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, with the degree of TrkA:p85 association positively regulated by CD2AP levels. CD2AP also regulates NGF signaling through AKT, but not ERK, and regulates long-range signaling though TrkA+\/RAB5+ signaling endosomes. CD2AP mRNA and protein levels were increased in neurons during collateral sprouting but decreased following injury, suggesting that, although typically considered together, these two adult axonal growth processes are fundamentally different. These data position CD2AP as a major intracellular signaling molecule coordinating NGF signaling to regulate collateral sprouting and structural plasticity of intact adult axons. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Growth of noninjured axons in the adult nervous system contributes to adaptive and maladaptive plasticity, and dysfunction of this process may contribute to neurologic pathologies. Functional screening of genes regulated during growth of noninjured axons revealed CD2AP as a positive regulator of axon outgrowth. A novel association of CD2AP with TrkA and p85 suggests a distinct intracellular signaling pathway regulating growth of noninjured axons. This may also represent a novel mechanism of generating specificity in multifunctional NGF signaling. Divergent regulation of CD2AP in different axon growth conditions suggests that separate mechanisms exist for different modes of axon growth. CD2AP is the first signaling molecule associated with adult sensory axonal collateral sprouting, and this association may offer new insights for NGF\/TrkA-related Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.",

Using gaseous mercury and gold sensing films as a test case, the cantilever test results clearly show as much as a factor of 2.4 times the sensor response over a simple mass loaded inverted mesa structure. Additionally, the micro bridge sensor results demonstrate that film stress due to gas film interactions can be coupled into an active acoustic region even if the sensing film is isolated from the active acoustic area.

Most research studies have used discrete sampling, i.e. weeds are counted within a quadrat, on a grid basis. Few have mapped weeds at a whole-field scale, either with a resolution appropriate to spraying operations or key ecological processes. Statistical analyses used to describe the data can be divided into two main types, spatially implicit (also at the scale of the sampling unit) or spatially explicit, in which the location of individuals is included in the analyses. Spatially implicit methods can be strongly affected by quadrat size and mean density and are of doubtful benefit. More attention is required to address sampling resolution issues for spatially explicit methods. Our understanding of the formation and dynamics of spatial pattern, as well as predicting the consequences of site-specific management, can be improved with models. Unfortunately, most models consider only newly expanding patches and appear incapable of predicting spatial distributions when an area has been fully invaded. More detailed biological information is required if models are to become more realistic and informative. We also need to ensure that we understand the spatial processes in the context of the whole field environment, to optimize the success of site-specific weed management in the longer term.",

They disagree with the previously held view that the blood supply to the thoracic cord is more tenuous than elsewhere. They also put forward the opinion that the collateral arterial supply to the median anterior spinal artery is segmental although the vessels are often very small. This is in addition to the large collateral vessels, such as described by Adamkiewicz. An interesting feature is their demonstration of a communication between the anterior and posterior venous drainage areas which is achieved by a large venous trunk running directly from front to back and skirting the central canal, uniting the anterior and posterior median venous trunks.

The pickle curing was carried out at temperatures of 5 degrees C and 11 degrees C after cutting the meat into little pieces of about 1.5 cm. Adecrease in cesium activity was measured by means of gamma-spectrometry at given time intervals after the process was started. It was proved that the efficiency of this process is mostly influenced by replacement of the pickle solution and by the duration of the process. A decrease in the cesium activity of about 80% was achieved without the change of the pickle after seven hours of curing.

        "abstrak":"Botswana continues to have a high level of HIV prevalence, with about 17% of the population living with HIV AIDS (BAIS IV, 2013). Female sex workers are classified among the most at risk population group in the country. However, sub-national disaggregated data on new infections are not available. Hence, there is a need to focus great attention on other proxies of infection. The present study examines predictors of HIV testing among female sex workers (FSWs) in Botswana. The FSWs were recruited into the study using the time-location cluster sampling method (TLS) to collect data on prevalence and incidence of HIV and other STIs and their risk factors for HIV. The logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate crude odds ratios and identify the factors associated with having an HIV test among the FSWs. HIV prevalence among sex workers in Botswana was found to be 3 times higher than in the general population. Analysis of the results shows that the sex workers most likely to seek HIV testing were young women with no children. The odds of testing for HIV were almost 4 times more for FSWs who had first sex older as compared to the odds of testing for those who are 17 to 19 years old. Lack of or inconsistent condom use and currently having symptoms of STIs such as lower abdominal pain and genital ulcerations were also factors associated with HIV testing. Results further show that FSW hold little discrimination and stigma related attitudes towards PLWA. FSWs have little participation in the HIV prevention, treatment and care efforts currently accessed by the general population. It is recommended is that this framework should also be extended to FSW’s and their clients in order to curb HIV and STIs. \n \n Key words: Female sex workers, HIV testing, Botswana, prevalence, associated factors, odds ratio.",

We hypothesized that with acute warming the structure and function of neuronal membranes in the Antarctic notothenioid fish Chaenocephalus aceratus are more vulnerable to perturbation than membranes in the more thermotolerant notothenioid Notothenia coriiceps. Fluidity was quantified in synaptic membranes, mitochondrial membranes, and myelin from brains of both species of Antarctic fishes. Polar lipid compositions and cholesterol contents were analyzed in myelin; cholesterol was measured in synaptic membranes. Thermal profiles were determined for activities of two membrane-associated proteins, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Na+\/K+-ATPase (NKA), from brains of animals maintained at ambient temperature or exposed to their critical thermal maxima (CTMAX). Synaptic membranes of C. aceratus were consistently more fluid than those of N. coriiceps (P < 0.0001). Although the fluidities of both myelin and mitochondrial membranes were similar among species, sensitivity of myelin fluidity to in vitro warming was greater in N. coriiceps than in C. aceratus (P < 0.001), which can be explained by lower cholesterol contents in myelin of N. coriiceps (P < 0.05). Activities of both enzymes, AChE and NKA, declined upon CTMAX exposure in C. aceratus, but not in N. coriiceps. We suggest that hyper-fluidization of synaptic membranes with warming in C. aceratus may explain the greater stenothermy in this species, and that thermal limits in notothenioids are more likely to be influenced by perturbations in synaptic membranes than in other membranes of the nervous system.",

Furthermore, high soil BD reduced aerenchyma lacunae and led to the formation of structural features such as fibrous strands. These morphological and anatomical changes were not reflected in tissue chemistry, with lignin levels averaging 17.0 ± 0.6%, although roots grown in high BD had higher nitrogen levels.

        "tahun_terbit":2010,
        "abstrak":"A hybridized genetic algorithm is proposed to determine a repair schedule for a network of bridges. The schedule aims for the lowest overall cost while maintaining each bridge at satisfactory quality conditions. Appreciation, deterioration, and cost models are employed to model real-life behaviour. To reduce the computational time, pre-processing algorithms are used to determine an initial genome that is closer to the optimal solution rather than a randomly generated genome. A post-processing algorithm that locates a local optimal solution from the output of the genetic algorithm is employed for further reduction of computational costs. Experimental work was carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in determining the bridge repair schedule. The addition of a pre-processing algorithm improves the results if the simulation period is constrained. If the simulation is run sufficiently long all pre-processing algorithms converge to the same optimal solution. If a pre-processing algorithm is not implemented, however, the simulation period increases significantly. The cost and deterioration tests also indicate that certain preprocessing algorithms are better suited for larger bridge networks. The local search performed on the genetic algorithm output is always seen as a positive add-on to further improve results.",

        "abstrak":"BACKGROUND\nPostoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a well-recognized complication of cardiac and noncardiac surgery. However, contradictory results concerning postoperative mental function have been reported. The aim is to determine the effect of anesthetic techniques (general or spinal) on cognitive functions using more sensitive neuropsychological tests in patients undergoing urological surgery.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nA total of thirty patients were enrolled in the study and assigned to receive either general (n = 15) or spinal (n = 15) anesthesia. A battery of neuropsychological tests including Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Iowa Gambling Task, Stroop Color-Word Test, N-back Task and Continuous Performance Test was performed preoperatively and three days later.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe two experimental groups were similar at baseline assessment of cognitive function. Although there were no statistically significant differences between general and spinal anesthetic groups with respect to Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Iowa Gambling Task, a significant intergroup difference between pre-and postoperative N-back scores was detected in the general anesthesia group (p = 0.001 & p = 0.004). In addition, patients within this group had significantly higher error rates on the Stroop Color-Word (p = 0.019) and Continuous Performance Tests (p = 0.045). In contrast, patients receiving spinal anesthesia exhibited little change or marginal improvement on all subscales of the battery.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings indicate significant decline in specific aspects of mental function among patients who were administered general anesthesia compared with the other technique. It seems that spinal anesthesia contributes to lower disturbance after surgery.",

        "abstrak":"Purpose\/Objective(s): Stage II endometrial cancer is relatively uncommon. There is no consensus for appropriate adjuvant therapy in endometrial cancer patients with cervical stromal involvement (FIGO stage II). This study investigates how adjuvant treatments and tumor characteristics influence OS and DFS in stage II patients in order to establish better treatment guidelines. Materials\/Methods: This multi-institution, IRB approved, study is a retrospective review of 40 surgically staged endometrial cancer patients with cervical stromal involvement treated from 1993 to 2009. KaplanMeier estimates were used to evaluate OS and DFS. Results: The average age for all patients was 61 (36-83). Patient OS was 85% at three years and 67% at five years. There were no significant differences in age, histology, depth of invasion, comorbid conditions, surgical staging or recurrence between patients who received RT and those who did not receive RT. However, patients with FIGO grade 1 cancers were less likely to receive RT (p<0.007). Patients treated with RT had a similar 5 year OS (nZ33, 69%) to those treated with surgery only (nZ7, 60%, pZ0.7462). There were no OS differences when evaluating by grade, histology, or depth of invasion between patients who did and did not receive RT. Four patients recurred out of the 40 who were treated. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics are outlined in table 1. Three were local recurrences, and one presented with concurrent local and distant failure. Our only vaginal cuff recurrence had a grade 1 tumor and had not received adjuvant RT, but was salvaged with RT in a timely manner after the recurrence. The remaining three recurrences occurred in patients who received radiation near the time of surgery, and all died from complications related to their cancer after recurrence. Conclusions: In this retrospective series, patients receiving RT had higher grade tumors. Despite this, OS was comparable between the RT and the no RT cohorts. Endometrial cancer patients with cervical stromal involvement likely receive better locoregional control with the addition of adjuvant RT, and we continue to advocate for RT in most cases.

Three types of panel data regression models--ordinary, fixed, and random effects--are developed and compared for motorcycle usage. The estimation results show that motorcycle ownership in the previous year does exercise a significantly positive effect on the number of motorcycles owned by households in the current year, suggesting that the state dependence effect does exist in motorcycle ownership decisions. In addition, the fixed effects model is the preferred specification for modeling motorcycle usage, indicating strong evidence for existence of heterogeneity.

To address this challenge, industrialized nations have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and undertaken commitments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary agents linked to anthropogenic alteration of earth’s climate. By contrast, the US government, led by the Bush Administration, has rejected mandatory targets for curbing emissions under the Protocol, and has instead pursued voluntary mitigation measures amid a larger push for clean coal and ‘‘next generation’’ nuclear technologies. These actions in total have fueled global perceptions that the US is not acting in substantial ways to address climate change. Nevertheless, action within the US is indeed moving forward, with states, cities and regional partnerships filling the federal leadership vacuum. This paper reviews the diverse policies, strategies, and cooperative frameworks that have emerged at regional, state and local levels to guide climate protection, and identifies the environmental and economic benefits linked to such programs.

        "abstrak":"It was proposed that the human visual system analyzes images into square wavelets. To test this view, comparisons were made between the perceived similarity-dissimilarity of alphabet letters and the wavelet analyses of those same letters. For the proposal to be considered tenable, the coefficients of the wavelet analysis of similar letters must be similar, and the coefficients of the wavelet analysis of dissimilar letters must be dissimilar. From a selection of 12 letters, four pairs of letters had been reported by Van der Heijden, Malhas, and Van den Roovaart as very similar, and four other pairs of letters dissimilar. Each of the 12 letters was separately depicted in 8×8 matrices, and the signal represented by each of the matrices was analyzed into square wavelets using a new and original procedure which yielded a single set of coefficients for each matrix. Correlations between sets of coefficients were high (r ranged from .88 to 58) for those letter pairs judged high in similarity; correlations were low (r ranged from −02 to .29) for those letter pairs judged low in similarity. When the correlations between the coefficients of wavelets of all eight-letter pairs were compared with the judged similarity-dissimilarity of all eight-letter pairs, the linear agreement was statistically significant. Agreement was found between the neurophysiological mapping of receptive fields of visual cortical neurons and the vectors or the pattern of pluses and minuses which characterized the wavelet analysis. Furthermore, regeneration of the visual image, or the pattern of neural activity representing the image, could be described by a tree-like flow of information among visual cortical neurons which received response data from visual receptive fields, the response data being wavelet coefficients. Results indicate the analysis accurately produces reliable transformations of visual patterns and may be a process used by the visual system.",

XRD and POM results showed that the SiCnp additions reduce the crystallite thickness and spherulite size of mPE. HDT measurements revealed that SiCnp additions enhance the thermal stability of mPE considerably. Tensile test showed that the addition of 2 wt% SiCnp improves the Young's modulus and yield strength of mPE at the expenses of elongation at break and impact strength.

        "abstrak":"SrCo{sub 0.5}FeO{sub x} (SCF) is an attractive material for oxygen separation membranes and for use in catalytic membrane reactors. While tubes of this material have been prepared by extrusion, further improvements in oxygen transport performance may be gained by preparing thinner membranes on porous supports. In this paper, we will discuss the deposition of thick films by spray deposition and centrifugal casting, and thin films by pyrolysis of chemical precursors. For the chemically derived thin films, porous MgO supports were used as membrane supports. Three types of precursor solutions were employed for dipcoating: a Pechini type solution, a nitrate-based solution, and a citrate-based solution. To prevent the infiltration of the precursor into the support, the support was backfilled with a material that decomposed at higher temperatures than the precursors. Cracking due to the volume changes during drying and pyrolysis of the precursors is discussed. Thick films were prepared by spray coating and centrifugal casting. Spray deposition of thick film membranes was accomplished by air brushing SCF from a water-based suspension onto the surface of a porous MgO support. Films on the interior surface of the supports were prepared by centrifugal casting using a xylene\/butanol-based SCF suspension. Unlike extruded tubes, thick films undergo constrained sintering due to the presence of the support, which greatly reduces the densification rate. For membranes prepared by both approaches, we will discuss the effects of heating schedules on membrane microstructure, densification behavior, and cracking.",

There is no outside funding or potential conflict of interest.\n\n\nPATIENT SAMPLE\nA patient with anaphylaxis during anterior spinal fusion.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nLaboratory assays for tryptase, gelatin-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), and total IgE.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 14-year-old male with myelomeningocele and scoliosis was treated with anterior spinal fusion from T12 to L3. Gelfoam sponges were applied during the preparation of the disc spaces. Approximately 1 hour later, Floseal hemostatic matrix was applied to a briskly bleeding screw hole in the L3 vertebral body, and the patient experienced an abrupt onset of hypotension and ventilatory difficulty. Epinephrine, dexamethasone, and blood products were administered for hemodynamic support while the surgical site was closed. Removal of the drapes revealed a widespread erythematous rash, and the patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit. When stable 3 days later, he returned to the operating room for completion of the spinal fusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPostoperative laboratory assays were sent that revealed elevated levels of tryptase, total IgE, porcine, and bovine gelatin-specific IgE. The patient was counseled to avoid gelatin-containing products. At 6-month follow-up, his instrumented spine was radiographically fused and he reported no further allergic issues.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAnaphylaxis may occur because of animal gelatin components of topical hemostatic agents. Previous reports have focused on the thrombin components. Care should be taken in the administration of these products, particularly in the atopic individual.",

        "abstrak":"Norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (Ang II), by promoting extracellular Ca2+ influx, increase Ca2+\/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) activity, leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), resulting in release of arachidonic acid (AA) for prostacyclin synthesis in rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the mechanism by which CaMKII activates MAPK is unclear. The present study was conducted to determine the contribution of AA and its metabolites as possible mediators of CaMKII-induced MAPK activation by NE, Ang II, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in vascular smooth muscle cells. NE-, Ang II-, and EGF-stimulated MAPK and cPLA2 were reduced by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and lipoxygenase but not by cyclooxygenase. NE-, Ang II-, and EGF-induced increases in Ras activity, measured by its translocation to plasma membrane, were abolished by CYP450, lipoxygenase, and farnesyltransferase inhibitors. An AA metabolite of CYP450, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), increased the activities of MAPK and cPLA2 and caused translocation of Ras. These data suggest that activation of MAPK by NE, Ang II, and EGF is mediated by a signaling mechanism involving 20-HETE, which is generated by stimulation of cPLA2 by CaMKII. Activation of Ras\/MAPK by 20-HETE amplifies cPLA2 activity and releases additional AA by a positive feedback mechanism. This mechanism of Ras\/MAPK activation by 20-HETE may play a central role in the regulation of other cellular signaling molecules involved in cell proliferation and growth.",

Of the 85 SIV-related deaths recorded in the pathology files to date, tissues from 19 animals were chosen for further study because of thickening, disruption, inflammation, or other abnormality to any layer of the vascular wall. The lesion was characterized by special stains, immunoperoxidase procedures, and ultrastructural examination.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAffected monkeys of both sexes varied in age from 4 months to 17 years at the time of inoculation and survived from 41 days to 4 years after infection. Pulmonary arteries were affected in all 19 animals, while vessels in other parenchymal organs were involved less frequently. In addition to sometimes marked intimal thickening with luminal occlusion, the internal elastic laminae were fragmented and interrupted. Seven of 19 animals had pulmonary thromboses with varying degrees of organization and recanalization. Immunohistochemical studies, special stains, and ultrastructural analyses revealed the thickened intimae to be composed predominantly of collagen, extracellular matrix, and smooth muscle cells. Ultrastructurally, endothelial cells from both early (no intimal thickening) and advanced lesions were plump, vacuolated, and often disorganized and detached from the subendothelial space. Increased numbers of macrophages (CD68+) were found in the adventitia and occasionally in the thickened intima and media. Rare, fully differentiated macrophages (CD68+, 25F9+) were demonstrated in lumina of affected vessels, some of which expressed p27 SIV gag protein. However, the lesion was not uniformly associated with localization of either viral protein or RNA at the site using immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization, respectively. A similar arterial lesion has been described in children with AIDS.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe morphologic findings in macaques and their similarity to arteriosclerotic changes induced by experimental endothelial damage in other species collectively suggest that arteriopathy in AIDS may represent a manifestation secondary to primary endothelial injury.",

This innovative approach to recruitment and selection of newly qualified registered nurses aims to attract and retain registered nurses that are fit for purpose, give value for money (Burke et al, 2014) and meet the challenges posed by the increasing diversity of older people; their care needs, preferences and affluence (Productivity Commission, 2008). \n \n \nImplementation of the innovation \n \nA total of 100 applicants were invited to attend an interview and assessment day comprising five MMI’s, consisting of scenario, role play and clinically based questions scored against assessment standardised rubrics. \n \nMethods used to assess the innovation \n \nAt the conclusion of the interview and assessment day interviewers and candidates were invited to evaluate their experience via a short questionnaire comprising both qualitative and quantitative questions. \n \nKey findings \n \nHaving established reliability and validity in assessment of non-cognitive attributes amongst applicants to medical schools (Lemay et al, 2007) (O’Brien et al, 2011) (Dowell et al, 2012), MMI’s are gaining popularity as a means of selecting people with required attributes into other healthcare sectors (Perkins et al, 2013). Following a review of the literature we believe that this is the first time that an MMI protocol has been utilized in Australia and the wider international community for selection of newly qualified registered nurses into an aged care organisation. Results of the evaluation of our MMI protocol would suggest that the MMI protocol could enhance the likelihood of successfully selecting practitioners where core values such as empathy and ethical judgements are crucial (Perkins et al, 2013) and are matched with a genuine desire to specialise in aged care.",

A number of different approaches to chromatographic chiral resolutions have been evaluated for their ability to resolve the enantiomers of racemic beta blocking drugs, Three chiral HPLC columns were investigated; a cyclodextrin phase, an (R)-3,5-dinitrabezoylphenylglycine phase and a protein phase. The acid glycoprotein phase successfully resolved atenolol, alprenolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, propranolol and verapamil with 0.01M phosphate buffer eluents modified with either acetonitrile or isopropanol. The (R)-3,5-dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine phase was used with eluents of Isopropanol in hexane and resolutions of propranolol, oxprenolol, metoprolol, alprenolol and pronethalol were achieved after formation of the 1- or 2-naphthamide derivatives, although no separations were achieved for the underivatised samples. The cyclodextrin phase was also found to be unsuccessful in resolving underivatised samples of propranolol and verapamil. However preliminary results indicate that resolutions are possible after the formation of their trifluoroacetyl derivatives. The cyclodextrin phase was also successfully used to resolve the enantiomers of chlorpheniramine and the geometric isomers of clomiphene. In addition to the chiral HPLC stationary phases, a (+)-10-camphorsulphonic acid mobile phase additive was investigated, although this was found to be completely unsuccessful. Finally the use of a chiral diamide GLC column was investigated. This was not suited to the analysis of beta blockers, even after derivatisation, although derivatised amino acids were well resolved. The use of computer modelling to predict the degree of separation of enantlomers was also investigated for the (R)-3,5-dinitrabenzoyl phenylglycine phase, with the interaction energies between the phase and both isomers of each compound calculated for the most stable conformation. From a comparison with the experimental results, it was shown that this approach to prediction was unsuccessful.",

It confirms that hadronisation effects are diminished while the uncertainty from the choice of the renormalisation scale will dominate.

The exchange of heat and water with the atmosphere causes the density of the surface waters to change, with subsequent downwelling and upwelling resulting as the system relaxes toward convective equilibrium. The characteristics of this atmosphere–ocean exchange are examined by studying the temporal variability of the buoyancy flux at OWS Bravo, a location where deep water formation is known to occur. The authors find that there is significant high-frequency variability in the buoyancy flux attributable to the passage of synoptic weather systems, variability that is masked by monthly analyses. At high latitudes, precipitation plays a significant role in the buoyancy flux. If it is ignored, the buoyancy loss is overestimated (positive coordinate is downward). Precipitation also causes the buoyancy flux to become positive during the passage of a cyclone. The timescale for this ...",

Until now, the role of the earth’s crust has been more or less ignored. In our opinion, deep-reaching open, interconnected tectonic fault systems may provide possible reaction habitats ranging from nano- to centimetre and even larger dimensions for the formation of prebiotic molecules. In addition to the presence of all necessary raw materials including phosphate, as well as variable pressure and temperature conditions, we suggest that supercritical CO2 as a nonpolar solvent could have played an important role. A hypothetical model for the origin of life is proposed which will be used to design crucial experiments for the model’s verification. Because all proposed processes could still occur in tectonic faults at the present time, it may be possible to detect and analyse the formation of prebiotic molecules in order to assess the validity of the proposed hypothesis.",

Ed. Jean Canavaggio. Madrid: Casa de Velázquez, 1995. 351-80 [356-8]). With an eager audience and a fixed stage, playwrights found a new source of support and, as seems natural to us in a postmodern capitalist society, wrote to please those who paid. Equally naturally, those who resisted the change decried the sacrifice of art for the sake of selling tickets to plays crafted by poets they saw as dismissive, even disdainful, of the standards and rules of esthetics, style, and morality.

A total of 309 calls were logged by the interns and 107 by the nurses. Each intern had 17 calls on average (range 6 to 33) per 12-hour period. Of the calls 27% occurred after midnight, 25% disrupted sleeping, and 19% interrupted direct patient contact. Overall, the most common reasons for paging interns were related to prescribing of medications (42% of the calls), direct patient assessment (25%) and reporting of laboratory results (18%). According to the nurses, there were no delays in the interns' responding to the pages, and 61% of the calls led to a new physician order.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPaging frequently interrupts interns during work and rest on night calls. Assessment of paging patterns may be useful in identifying specific interventions to reduce the number of calls so that interns will have fewer interruptions during patient encounters and more rest. The collection of data from nurses in a routine nursing audit may be useful for evaluating the communication between interns and nurses and, indirectly, for assessing interns' workload.",

The CeO2–Sm2O3\/SiO2 catalyst showed excellent catalytic efficiency with ~89 % cyclohexene conversion and ~90 % selectivity for allylic products (i.e., 2-cyclohexen-1-ol and 2-cyclohexene-1-one), while only ~50 and ~35 % cyclohexene conversion was observed, respectively, over CeO2\/SiO2 and CeO2 catalysts. Systematic characterization of the designed catalysts was undertaken to correlate their catalytic activity with the physicochemical properties using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) techniques. The results revealed that doping of Sm3+ into the ceria lattice and simultaneous dispersion of resultant Ce–Sm mixed oxides on the silica surface led to improved structural, acidic, and catalytic properties. The better catalytic efficiency of CeO2–Sm2O3\/SiO2 was due to high specific surface area, more structural defects, and high concentration of strong acid sites, stimulated by synergistic interaction between various oxides in the catalyst. The cyclohexene conversion and selectivity for allylic products depended on the reaction temperature, nature of solvent, molar ratio of cyclohexene to oxidant, and reaction time. Possible reaction pathways are proposed for selective allylic oxidation of cyclohexene towards 2-cyclohexen-1-ol and 2-cyclohexene-1-one products.Graphical AbstractSiO2-supported CeO2–Sm2O3 nanocatalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic performance with superior selectivity for allylic products in liquid-phase selective oxidation of cyclohexene under mild reaction conditions.",

In our experimental setup based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, it is found that the electric field induced shift of the interference fringes crucially depends on the degree of polarization of the incident light. We show that the experimental data can be theoretically described in terms of the electrically dependent Pancharatnam relative phase. The electric field dependence of both the Pancharatnam and geometric phases is evaluated by comparing the experimental and theoretical results.",

Thus we introduced a new approach in which the user knowledge I taken into the consideration to extract the rules through user interactive system.

Surprisingly few studies connect the development of students’ cognitive and metacognitive skills for learning in the laboratory practical with foundational skills for researching.

However, pedagogical models to make research skills explicit and guide library-faculty collaborations are lacking. This study explores the Research Skill Development (RSD) framework (Willison & O'Regan 2006\/ 2018; see the first article in this issue) to extrapolate students’ research skills in a first-year biology practical unit. A qualitative research design was applied to identify research skills in the unit’s laboratory manual and in descriptive observations of students in five laboratory practicals. Results show students engaged in the research skills articulated by the RSD, yet these skills were implied rather than explicitly taught. Implications suggest that fundamental research skills which enable student preparedness for research can be overlooked in practical curricula. Research skills remaining unrecognised impacts learning and teaching, including the contribution librarians could make in this context. Findings demonstrated that the RSD is a useful theoretical construct and a priori framework to make research skills visible to educators.",

We aim to identify the significant effects of the biomechanics of types I, III, and V collagen on physio-pathological changes of murine hearts leading to heart failure. Immediately post-MI, heart reduces its function (EF = 40.94 ± 2.12%) while sarcomeres’ dimensions are unchanged. Strikingly, as determined by immunohistochemistry staining, type V collagen fraction significantly grows in remote and scar for sustaining de novo-types I and III collagen fibers’ assembly while hindering their enzymatic degradation. Thereafter, the compensatory heart function (EF = 63.04 ± 3.16%) associates with steady development of types I and III collagen in a stiff remote (12.79 ± 1.09 MPa) and scar (22.40 ± 1.08 MPa). In remote, the soft de novo-type III collagen uncoils preventing further expansion of elongated sarcomeres (2.7 ± 0.3 mm). Once the compensatory mechanisms are surpassed, the increased turnover of stiff type I collagen (>50%) lead to a pseudo-stable biomechanical regime of the heart (≅9 MPa) with reduced EF (50.55 ± 3.25%). These end-characteristics represent the common scenario evidenced in patients suffering from heart failure after MI.

        "tahun_terbit":2017,
        "abstrak":"Dear Sir, We read with great interest the article titled, BGastric remnant dilatation: A rare technical complication following Laparoscopic One Anastomosis (Mini) Gastric Bypass.^ [1] We would like to add our experience in the hope that this will complement the information, considering that we reported the first case in the world [2]. Acute gastric dilatation is a surgical emergency after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), usually known as biliopancreatic obstruction caused by obstruction at enteroenterostomy [3]. Although the incidence is low, this complication is an important cause of death after RYGB [4]. The laparoscopic mini gastric bypass (MGB) first reported by Rutledge was gradually accepted as an alternative to RYGB with better weight loss and less complication, especially in less intestinal obstruction [5]. New names such as one anastomotic gastric bypass (OAGB) or single anastomosis gastric bypass (SAGB) were proposed [6]. Although SAGB or MGB is a simplified bypass procedure with less complication than RYGB, acute gastric dilatation is still a possible early complication [7]. Acute gastric dilatation after MGB is less severe than that after RYGB because it does not carry a risk of developing a fulminant pancreatitis, although it may cause gastric wall perforation or necrosis if diagnosis is delayed. The diagnosis can be suspected on a plain abdominal radiograph that shows a distended fundus and then confirmed by using computed tomography (CT). About this rare complication, the most important point is to avoid complications, especially in the learning curve of this procedure. The author described elaborately in their letter the cause and prevention of developing acute gastric dilatation of MGB. I agree with the author that attention should be paid at the first cut when trying to create a long narrow gastric tube and leave a space of 2 cm from the greater curvature side. Instead of using a 60-mm stapler for the first cut, we preferred to use a 45-mm stapler for the first cut, which may reduce the risk of overcutting at the antrum. In the letter, the authors discussed the management of this complication and proposed to use diagnostic laparoscopy and correction surgery in emergency situations. The authors argued that tube gastrostomy adding 2% to operative risk was misleading. Today, percutaneous drainage of gastric remnant dilatation by CT scan or with echo guidance can be easily performed under local anesthesia [8–10]. The drainage is effective for symptom relief and to avoid emergency operation, whichmight put the patient in an unnecessary risk. An elective surgery can be arranged later. Corrective operation may be needed if the narrowing at the antrum persists. Either a sideto-side anastomosis, as the author suggested, or resection of the remnant stomach can resolve the problem. Thus far, we have experienced three cases (0.15%) of acute gastric dilatation among 2000 cases of SAGB. The incidence is lower than the incidence of 0.8% after RYGB [7]. Two of the three cases were successfully managed with percutaneous drainage. One patient received an elective surgery to remove the remnant stomach 1 month later because of persistent symptomatic narrowing. One patient presented with gastric bleeding and acute gastric dilatation filled with blood clot. Emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed to evacuate the blood clot, and continuous suture of the stapler line for hemostasis was applied. All the patients were discharged within 3 days uneventfully. In conclusion, this rare complication should be * Wei-Jei Lee wjlee_obesssurg_tw@yahoo.com.tw",

Both RNA species showed typical autocatalytic RNA amplification profiles with replication rates in the range of other RNA replicons. The replication products were heterogeneous in length; the different lengths appeared to be different replication intermediates. Both RNA were single-stranded with much internal base-pairing but low melting points. Their sequences were composed by permutations of certain sequence motives in both polarities separated by short oligo(A) and oligo(U) clusters.

        "tahun_terbit":1992,
        "abstrak":"In the early 1980s I had my first experience presenting a poster session at a professional meeting (the ASA is calling this a scholar-toscholar presentation in 1991). I came away from that exchange with a vision of its utility for teaching research methods. For several years now, my research methods students have prepared and hung poster presentations of their research projects the week prior to the final written project report. This activity was designed to enhance their skill in communicating the results of their term research project in a brief and visual way. The timing is such that feedback from classmates can inform a clearer final report. Over the years these poster presentations have evolved far beyond the oral presentation with supporting illustrations. The assignment instructions were originally drawn from the directions supplied to presenters by the Gerontological Society of America. These directions set the expectations for a large readable title, typed abstract, clear models or hypotheses, appropriate results summarized in tables, graphs, or pictures, and a conclusion. While students need to purchase poster board (one to two sheets) and a marker, students have little outside expense, but the labor has often pulled in their roommates and friends as the deadline looms. The students' supporters get exposed to the other projects as they come to hear the oral presentation for the one on which they worked. Aclass period is set aside and open to the public when students are available to discuss their research and answer questions. I send a flyer to all social science colleagues urging them to announce this period in their classes. The event becomes a reception that campus publicity people find interesting for local news stories. Encouraging introductory students to come by during this time (usually extended into the lunch hour to avoid schedule conflicts) piques their curiosity and sets up the research methods students as researchers and peer models. Many recent students have this memory of viewing a poster session earlier in their studies as they prepare their projects for presentation now. They draw on this background to prepare clear displays now that they are on the other side. This activity does not require additional materials beyond standard office supplies. Scheduling the space and arranging to hang the posters is all that's needed. (I usually request a ladder from housekeeping to help adjust track lighting as well as hang posters, but have sufficed with standing on a chair to reach the hooks.) Since a campus renovation made the old library into the social science center with offices and classrooms, we have been able to use the main lobby on the first floor. Displacing the usual art collection of pen and ink drawings that hangs there with the labors of student researchers each fall adds a sense of legitimacy to the use of the space for social science. Track lighting and picture hanging moldings are available with extra flat hooks added and a reusable set of strings cut in appropriate lengths. These strings have pre-tied loops for the hook ends and a loose end to tie through holes punched in the posters' corners (allow adjustment where reachable for easy balance). Everything can be hung in under one hour. To control air current movement of posters we have anchored lower corners with reusable plastic putty. (Warning: some textured wall coverings do not allow complete removal. ) I have used mobile bulletin boards with push pins in previous years. (The art department seldom uses these in the fall.) While the usual poster session at a professional meeting runs two hours, our exhibition lasts a week or more though students are only available to discuss their research at the special class period at the beginning of the week. The browsing between classes in our area lets the research have wider circulation. Those on campus who may have been subjects in some pro* The author wishes to thank Brenda D.

The shape of the flash was observed by use of a projector. Flashing was detected in pure PPS and 90\/10 PPS\/LCP blend but was not found in other compositions, including pure LCP. The DSC thermograms of the flash revealed both exothermic and endothermic peaks at around 120 o and 285 o C. The first peak, known as crystallization temperature on heating, occurred as a result of early crystalllzation of PPS. The observed double peaks indicated that the degree of crystallinlty was lower in the flash than in the molded part. The morphological studies revealed the presence of LCP fibrils in the skin region and droplets in the core region of 90\/10 PPS blend. The absence of flash was attributed to the diameters of the fibrils and droplets, which were found to increase with increasing LCP component",

        "abstrak":"Phasor Measurement Units have been applied on power system to improve the performance of power system state estimator for decades. As it is not practical to install one PMU at every bus in a power system due to its high cost, plenty of research focus on solving the optimal PMU placement (OPP) problem which is to determine a placement with minimum number of PMUs while ensuring network's observability. Since PMUs are mostly employed within transmission networks, most of the OPP algorithms are also designed for transmission networks. In recent years, distribution networks are evolving from passive to active because of increasing application of distribution energy resources, which raises the desire of more continuous monitoring of distribution networks. Traditional PMUs cannot be employed in distribution networks due to economic and technical constraints. The advent of μPMU makes it possible to employ phasor measurement devices in distribution networks. It is anticipated that distribution networks will be employed with μPMU in near future. This paper proposed a hybrid approach based on global search algorithm to solve the OPP problem in distribution networks. The drawback of global search method that consuming extensive computational time is overcome in this method by some preprocessing steps. Several IEEE distribution test feeders are used to examine the proposed placement method, and the results shows this placement approach is able to give the optimal solution while keeping the computational time in acceptance range.",

For improving such performance, this method takes residual echo due to reflected waves into account and uses a multi-tap echo-path model. To mitigate the increase in the method's computational complexity, it uses a size-reduced transfer function (TF) matrix instead of the full TF matrix. Specifically, this method extracts the dominant components of the loudspeaker signals adaptively by subspace tracking and estimates a size-reduced TF matrix that relates these dominant components to the residual echo. Simulation showed that the proposed method plus a wave-domain acoustic echo canceller (AEC) improved echo return loss enhancement by 10 dB compared to the conventional wave-domain echo reduction method plus the wave-domain AEC in a room with a reverberation time 180 ms.

        "tahun_terbit":2015,
        "abstrak":"Abstract A set of 57 novel canopy metrics of potential value for snow modeling were created from airborne LiDAR data. The metrics were meant to estimate size and relative location of gap openings around a point within forested areas, allowing for measures of the spatial arrangement of surrounding canopy elements. These new metrics were correlated with snow interception measured in the field (8488 manually measured snow interception points). The results were further compared to the correlation values between effective interception and traditionally used forest parameters (CC and LAI). The correspondence between all metrics was also analyzed in order to understand the potential cross correlation between each variable. LAI (average R: 0.57) demonstrated low correlations when directly compared to snow interception and further showed a large cross correlation with canopy closure (average R: 0.72). A new metric, ‘mean distance to canopy’ had the highest correlation (average R: 0.78) over all storm events to the effective interception. But in contrast to LAI, this metric did not show any cross correlation with canopy closure (CC). Likewise, ‘total gap area,’ an indirect measurement of apparent gap fraction (another new metric), also showed a high correlation to effective interception (average R: 0.72) without demonstrating a significant cross correlation to CC or to mean distance to canopy. These findings suggest that modeling forest snow processes with both CC and LAI may not be the best option due to both the low correlation of LAI as well as high cross correlation between these parameters. However, the pairing of mean distance to canopy and\/or total gap area with canopy closure could give more robust estimations of snow interception within heterogeneous terrain.",

These sediments were accumulated along the northern shelf of the east–west trending Tethys seaway. Submarine hardgrounds and nodular limestones were also formed on the Brianconnais High, today outcropping in the middle Penninic nappe pile of the Alps. Hardgrounds record strong and persistent current activity along the northern Tethys shelf and on the Brianconnais High during the Callovian and Early Oxfordian. The transition from hardgrounds to nodular limestones corresponds to a major reorganization of Tethys oceanography. The change occurred in Plicatilis ammonite Zone (Middle Oxfordian). Carbon isotope stratigraphy, calibrated against an ammonite-dated reference section in the French Subalpine Basin, serves as a correlation tool between ammonite-dated sections and successions with poor biostratigraphic resolution. Correlation demonstrates that the end of hardground formation was synchronous over wide parts of the northern Tethys. The change in shelf sedimentation coincides with a positive carbon isotope excursion with an amplitude of 1.5‰. The change in C-isotope stratigraphy indicates that observed reorganization of current patterns along the northern Tethys shelf was coupled with global change in oceanography and climate. We propose that the change in northern Tethys sedimentation was caused by opening of new seaways at a time of progressive collapse of Pangaea.",

Moreover, they are among the most interesting magnetic features to be studied in high spatial and temporal resolution in the solar photosphere. Their relevance for solar physics is not only given by their contribution to fundamental solar plasma physics on small scales but in addition due to their involvement in processes like the solar atmospheric heating problem (chromosphere and corona), their influence on granulation and hence the convective energy transport, as well as their contribution to the variations in total solar irradiance caused by their higher relative intensity. In this ongoing study we focus on the long-time evolution of statistical parameters of MBPs over the solar cycle. Are parameters like the mean intensity, average size\/diameter, and number of MBPs per unit surface element variable with time? If so, how do these parameters vary and is there a relationship to the solar cycle? In the actual contribution we will discuss preliminary results regarding the variation of the number of MBPs with time. We saw a decrease in the number of MBPs for the first years of observation (2006 until 2011) with two distinct local minima in the years 2009 and 2011.

        "abstrak":"Abstract. With the emergence of small consumer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the importance and interest of image-based depth estimation and model generation from aerial images has greatly increased in the photogrammetric society. In our work, we focus on algorithms that allow an online image-based dense depth estimation from video sequences, which enables the direct and live structural analysis of the depicted scene. Therefore, we use a multi-view plane-sweep algorithm with a semi-global matching (SGM) optimization which is parallelized for general purpose computation on a GPU (GPGPU), reaching sufficient performance to keep up with the key-frames of input sequences. One important aspect to reach good performance is the way to sample the scene space, creating plane hypotheses. A small step size between consecutive planes, which is needed to reconstruct details in the near vicinity of the camera may lead to ambiguities in distant regions, due to the perspective projection of the camera. Furthermore, an equidistant sampling with a small step size produces a large number of plane hypotheses, leading to high computational effort. To overcome these problems, we present a novel methodology to directly determine the sampling points of plane-sweep algorithms in image space. The use of the perspective invariant cross-ratio allows us to derive the location of the sampling planes directly from the image data. With this, we efficiently sample the scene space, achieving higher sampling density in areas which are close to the camera and a lower density in distant regions. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic benchmark dataset for quantitative evaluation and on a real-image dataset consisting of aerial imagery. The experiments reveal that an inverse sampling achieves equal and better results than a linear sampling, with less sampling points and thus less runtime. Our algorithm allows an online computation of depth maps for subsequences of five frames, provided that the relative poses between all frames are given.",

The AVP innervation of the lateral septum and the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus was moderately, although not significantly reduced. No age difference in AVP innervation was found in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus or in the nucleus of the solitary tract. OXT fiber density did not differ between young and old animals in the locus coeruleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the ambiguus nucleus. Thus, the aging process appears to affect AVP cells in a differential, rather than in a general way. Changes were found to be more pronounced in those areas where the AVP innervation is dependent upon circulating androgens.",

Although the values of erythrocyte morphometric characters and hematological parameters varied between males and females, the difference was only significant in the case of the neutrophil count, with more neutrophils in females. The mean erythrocyte count was 7.20 × 104\/mm3 (3.00 × 104–12.00 × 104\/mm3), mean leukocyte count was 3.10 × 103\/mm3 (0.58 × 103–7.75 × 103\/mm3), mean hematocrit (Hct) was 30.49% (15.60–46.00%), mean cell volume (MCV) was 4.57 × 103 fl (2.21 × 103–8.57 × 103 fl), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) was 0.75 × 103 pg (0.33 × 103–1.04 × 103 pg), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) was 16.61% (8.50–25.32%) and mean hemoglobin was 5.00 g\/dl (1.5–7.5 g\/dl). This is the first report on hematological parameters of B. yenyuanensis, and the results may serve as a reference for health assessment and future study of this species. Comparison of our results to those of other hynobiid salamanders indicated that hematological parameters have species-specific and genus-specific characteristics.",

The current work aims to contribute to the design of a complete biorefinery processing, using Fucus spiralis seaweed (brown division) as starting material, and to determine the potential of the derived waste as biosorbent of heavy metals in aqueous solution. The macroalgae waste was obtained after the sequential separation of polyphenols, fucoidan and alginate extracts from F. spiralis. The capacity of F. spiralis waste for Pb(II) removal was successfully tested through biosorption tests. The uptake of Pb(II) was found to be very fast (few hours to achieve equilibrium). Tests performed with an initial metal concentration of 20 mg\/L established the best adsorbent dosage (0.50 g\/L) and an optimum pH of 4.5. In these conditions, lead was almost completely removed from the aqueous solution. Maximum adsorption capacity predicted by Langmuir model was 132 ± 14 mg\/g (pH 4.5 ± 0.5, 20 °C). Desorption studies were conducted with different possible eluents. The best results were obtained with EDTA 0.1 mol\/L, generating a 95 ± 4% desorption. F. spiralis biomass can therefore be submitted to a complete biorefinery processing and design in the attempt to fulfil the \"zero-waste\" concept.",

The structure of aggregates formed from dust depends largely on the initial properties within the dust population, whether the grains are charged or uncharged, magnetic or non-magnetic. Theoretical simulations examining pairwise interactions between aggregates indicate that charged magnetic grains exhibit different growth behavior than populations consisting of exclusively charged or exclusively magnetic grains. This study extends that work to predict how chargedmagnetic grains influence grain growth within an astrophysical environment. An N-body simulation containing various mixtures of dust materials is used to examine the differences in dust coagulation in the presence of charged magnetic aggregates. The growth of the dust aggregates is analyzed to determine the effects that charged magnetic grains contribute to the evolution of the dust cloud. Aggregate structure is also analyzed to determine how the morphology differs from aggregates built completely from ballistic collisions to determine how gas-coupling changes as aggregates grow to larger sizes.

But we human beings are not just sinners, we are also sinned-against. Therefore I have written this master’s thesis on how experiences of being sinned against affect experiences of worship, or more specifically experiences of the main Sunday service with Eucharist in the Church of Sweden. \n \nFirst I did a survey which was spread in social media, with questions for those who selfidentify as sinned-against. Then I did qualitative interviews with 8 of those who answered the survey. The nature of the interviews was free, but I had prepared an interview guide which included the following 4 topics: 1. Person. 2. Worship. 3. Sinned-against. 4. How being sinned-against affects worship. \n \nIn order to understand what being sinned against does to a person, I have used the Korean concept of han. It offers a term for the experience, without limiting it to for example shame. To translate a concept from one culture to another is problematic, but since we don’t have a Swedish term han is the best one availiable. \n \nThe respondents find that they themselves have to create room in the service for experiences of being sinned against. It is possible for them to interpret some parts of the service as being about this kind of experiences, but they think that such an interpretation is artifical and does not exist in the liturgy itself. The most of the respondents also find it difficult when they experience that the worship does not speak truthfully about the life and God such as they know them. \n \nThe majority of the respondens wish for an opportunity in the Sunday service to express that they have been sinned-against, and to hear some words of promise as Gods response to their experiences. This thesis has shown that it is important that experiences of being sinned against become subjects not only of pastoral care, but also of liturgical care.",

The role of adjunctive corticosteroid treatment is not fully understood. Most guidelines on management of tuberculosis do not distinguish between tuberculous meningitis and CNS tuberculomas in terms of corticosteroid therapy. Methods We describe five patients with CNS tuberculomas who required intensified dexamethasone treatment for several months, in two cases up to 18 months. Results These patients were initially treated with the standard four-drug tuberculosis regimen and adjuvant dexamethasone. Neurological symptoms improved rapidly. However, multiple attempts to reduce or discontinue corticosteroids according to guideline recommendations led to clinical deterioration with generalized seizures or new CNS lesions. Thus, duration of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy was extended eventually leading to clinical cure and resolution of lesions. Conclusion In contrast to tuberculous meningitis, the treatment for CNS tuberculomas appears to require a prolonged administration of corticosteroids. These findings need to be verified in controlled clinical studies.",

        "abstrak":"Energy proportional computing (EPC) enables the allocation of energy to tasks depending on computational demands. Computing at full speed and then dynamically turning off modules when they are not required for a period of time can be used to obtain EPC and it is an alternative to voltage scaling techniques in which the computation is slowed down. This project investigates the viability of physical power gating FPGA devices that incorporate a hardened processor in a different power domain. The run-time power gating approach is applied to FPGA devices that incorporate a hardened multi-processor. power down followed by a full reconfiguration can be controlled by the embedded processor autonomously is shown. The time that the FPGA must remain in power-on state is feed and remaining power is saved when the required voltage is lowered below critical level. These modules take into account the overheads of controlling the programmable voltage regulators interfaced to the FPGA and the overhead of the reconfiguration needed when the device must be returned to the active state. INTRODUCTION ENERGY and power efficiency in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has been estimated to be up to one order of magnitude worse than in ASICs and this limits their applicability in energy constraint applications. Since FPGAs are fabricated using CMOS transistors power can be divided into two main categories, dynamic power and static power. As a result, voltage scaling is often combined with frequency scaling in order to compensate for the variation of circuit delay. Essentially, voltage and frequency scaling attempts to exploit performance margins so that tasks complete just in time obtaining power and energy savings. An example of this is dynamic voltage and frequencyscaling (DVFS) which is a technique that uses a number of pre-evaluated voltage operational points to scale power, energy and performance. With DVFS, for worst case since it operates in an open-loop configuration. For this reason, in adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) with insitu detectors run-time monitoring of performance variability in the silicon is used together with system characterization to influence the voltage closed-loop configuration. Addressing these issues the contributions of this work can be summarised as follows: 1.We present a power adaptive architecture based on in-situ detectors and adaptive voltage scaling suit-able for commercially available FPGAs. 2.We present fuzzy algorithm in control unit for control the power 3.We demonstrate the power and energy savings possible. RELATED WORK In order to identify ways of reducing the power consumption in FPGAs, some research has focused on developing new FPGA architectures implementing multi threshold voltage techniques, multi-Vdd techniques and power gating techniques.Other strategies have proposed modifying the map and place&route algorithms to provide power aware implementation. This related work is targeted towards FPGA manufacturers and tool designers to adopt in new platforms and design environments. On the other hand, a user level approach is proposed in. A dynamic voltage scaling strategy for commercial FPGAs that aims to minimise power consumption for a giving task is presented in their work. In this methodology, the voltage of the FPGA is controlled by a power supply that can vary the internal voltage of the FPGAs. A dynamic voltage scaling strategy is proposed to minimise energy consumption of an FPGA based processing ele-ment, by adjusting first the voltage, then searching for a suitable frequency at which to operate. Significant savings in power and energy are measured as voltage is scaled from its nominal value of 1.2 V down to its limit of 0.9 V. In this paper we present the application of in-situ detectors to commercial FPGAs that deploy arbitrary user designs.. During testing, devices that can maintain nomi-nal performance at 0.9 V are programmed with the voltage identification bit set to 1. A board capable of using this feature can read the voltage identification bit and if active can lower the supply to 0.9 V reducing power by around 30 percent.

To determine the variables having significant influence on the length of stay. Methods: Patients between the ages of 10 and 20 who had surgery for AIS during the period 1\/1\/96 to 31\/12\/2000 were identified from theatre logbooks. Patients who had anterior and posterior surgery were excluded. A retrospective analysis of case notes was carried out. Fisher’s Exact Test was used to analyse categorical data while Student T Test was used for continuous variables. Results: Thirty-three patients fulfilled the entry criteria. Sixteen male patients were operated on in Starship Hospital. Seventeen patients had operations at Mercy Hospital but only one of these was male. The groups were not significantly different in terms of age, sex, weight, ASA, number of levels, or curve pattern. The Mercy Hospital patients had a significantly lower Cobb angle (by 12 degrees). The Starship Hospital patients tended to retain their PCA pumps longer and tended to use more PCA morphine, however, this result was not significant. The Mercy Hospital patients had their intravenous access removed and were mobilised significantly earlier (1.7 and 1.9 days earlier respectively). The Mercy Hospital patients had a significantly shorter length of stay (6.4 and 8.4 days respectively, p= 0.0002). Conclusions: Patients at the Mercy Hospital had a significantly shorter post-operative length of stay after AIS surgery. This was not completely explained by the lower Cobb angle seen in the Mercy Hospital patients. The Mercy Hospital patients had their drips removed and were mobilised significantly earlier. This may be the key to early discharge.",

Eventually students who have trouble with self-studying in an effective manner may end up failing courses because of this. When students realise they have a (self-study) problem they can seek aid by contacting the academic counsellor. However, there are problems with this workflow: students often need time to acknowledge they are having issues. Then, even when students contact the academic counsellor to get help, it is a difficult task to provide personalised support for each student. In this thesis we investigate the feasibility of a self-study support agent that can assist students with feedback on their self-study behavior. This agent can support students next to the academic counsellors. An agent can continuously track students and provide immediate feedback, whereas counsellors have a limited amount of time available (per student). As part of this thesis we conduct a focus group with academic counsellors, organise a workshop with first year students to create a design for a prototype self-study support agent. Thereafter we implement this prototype and use this in an experiment where the activities of several first year students are tracked over the period of two weeks. Then we analyse the data collected with our prototype agent. In doing so we show that the concept of the self-study support agent is feasible. We envision that future work can realise actual deployment of a self-study support agent.",

It is caused by failure to restore adequate blood flow to the watershed areas of the sigmoid colon. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate erythrocyte flux to defined areas of the colon immediately after repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and to determine the critical level of erythrocyte flux below which revascularization of the colon is indicated. A group of 22 patients with a ruptured infrarenal aortic aneurysm in whom the inferior mesenteric artery was ligated at surgery were studied prospectively. Multiple LDF measurements of bowel blood flow (four per bowel segment) were performed on 103 intestinal segments intraoperatively using a Periflux 4001 Master with a PF 415:1 probe. In addition, histologic findings of ischemically injured intestine biopsied at routine postoperative endoscopy or postmortem examination were compared with the LDF records. There was a 41% incidence (9\/22 patients) of postoperative colonic ischemia with a significant decrease in colonic erythrocyte flux below 50 perfusion units (PU) intraoperatively in all nine patients (100%). Four patients had transmural colon necrosis, and two patients died, for an overall mortality of 27%. Five patients were identified as having mild or moderate intestinal ischemia and were treated conservatively. Another 14 patients had no clinical or endoscopic signs of ischemic colitis. Erythrocyte flux in those colonic segments were > 50 PU. An intraoperative LDF recording of < 50 PU achieved a sensitivity of 100% (32\/32 colon segments) and a positive prediction value of 100% in patients who developed ischemic colitis after surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. The results of this study demonstrate that LDF is a sensitive guide to and feasible method for evaluating critical colonic blood flow during repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The critical level of microvascular perfusion of the colon wall was found to be around 50 PU, below which revascularization of the colon should be considered to reduce the risk of subsequent ischemic colitis.",

        "abstrak":"Recommender System research suffers currently from a disconnect between the size of academic data sets and the scale of industrial production systems. In order to bridge that gap we propose to generate more massive user\/item interaction data sets by expanding pre-existing public data sets. User\/item incidence matrices record interactions between users and items on a given platform as a large sparse matrix whose rows correspond to users and whose columns correspond to items. Our technique expands such matrices to larger numbers of rows (users), columns (items) and non zero values (interactions) while preserving key higher order statistical properties. We adapt the Kronecker Graph Theory to user\/item incidence matrices and show that the corresponding fractal expansions preserve the fat-tailed distributions of user engagements, item popularity and singular value spectra of user\/item interaction matrices. Preserving such properties is key to building large realistic synthetic data sets which in turn can be employed reliably to benchmark Recommender Systems and the systems employed to train them. We provide algorithms to produce such expansions and apply them to the MovieLens 20 million data set comprising 20 million ratings of 27K movies by 138K users. The resulting expanded data set has 10 billion ratings, 864K items and 2 million users in its smaller version and can be scaled up or down.

In this work, we present in-situ X-ray strain measurements of the TGO layer on cycled TBC specimens under thermo-mechanical loading using high energy X-rays (~80.7- 86 keV) at Sector 1-ID of the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory. The evolution of TGO stresses was examined over one complete thermal cycle on TBC samples at various stages of the life fraction under mechanical loads. Quantitative results obtained through Pseudo-Voigt peak fitting of the (024) and (300) planes of α-Al2O3, show the evolution of strain in-situ over a thermal cycle. It was shown that increasing mechanical load resulted in reduced compression during a cycle to the point where tensile strain was observed in the TGO. This determination of critical conditions for strain evolution in early cycle specimens will serve to improve overall accuracy in life prediction of these coatings and contribute to developing methods of improving fatigue behavior.",

The main crops are bananas, tomatoes, and other special ones suitable for exportation. Fertilizers are applied in high quantities on the scarce land available. The relatively good vertical permeability of the soils favors the deep infiltration of irrigation return flows.Water is obtained by an extraordinary net of shaft wells and water galleries, supplemented when possible by surface reservoirs in the deep gullies. Water is distributed by an extensive network of pipes and canals, allowing the transportation of water to virtually any point from any water source. Water quality is widely variable, from almost rain water to brackish, with a high frequency of sodium bicarbonate types. Return flows, especially when water is applied with good irrigation techniques and the original quality is poor, are saline and contain chemicals leached from the fertilizers.On Tenerife Island, most of the return flows go to coastal aquifers, while most of the water comes from high-altitude water galleries. Agricultural pollution is not generally appraised, but it exists. It can be masked by the frequent, high natural nitrate content in groundwater. On Gran Canaria Island, since water comes mainly from deep shaft wells near the irrigated areas, the nitrate pollution is much more clear. On La Palma Island, besides the nitrate pollution, a potassium pollution of agricultural origin has been mentioned. Other situations on the remaining islands are also discussed.It can be concluded that agriculture is a big concern for the water quality in many areas and impairs its suitability for other uses. Because of the great depth of the water table, the nitrate pollution may not become obvious for many years, especially for the deep-water galleries.",

Two new feasible media, periosteum progenitor cell sheet (PPCS) and acellular collagen sheet (ACS), were utilized to promote tendon–bone healing. This study aimed to compare the effects of these two media on tendon–bone healing in a rabbit model. Methods Periosteum progenitor cells were harvested from rabbit tibial periosteum, cultivated on polymerized fibrin-coated dishes, and obtained as PPCS. ACS was prepared from rabbit small intestinal submucosa. Twenty rabbits were used in this study. Tendon grafts wrapped in cell sheet were pulled into a bone tunnel in a model of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Rabbits were sacrificed at 8 weeks postoperatively for histological, immunohistochemical, and biomechanical assay. Results The monolayer PPCS that had been wrapped around the tendon before surgery was analysed. Histological staining revealed that PPCS gave rise to higher collagen and glycosaminoglycan deposition with fibrocartilage formation than ACS at the tendon–bone junction at 8 weeks. In addition, PPCS produced significantly better mechanical results compared with ACS, including increased maximum load, stiffness, and maximum load per length of bone tunnel. Conclusions Single-layer PPCS significantly enhanced tendon–bone healing compared with ACS, with fibrocartilage formation at the tendon interface and superior biomechanical strength.",

We analyse the metal line systems using photo-ionization models allowing for inhomogeneities in the gas. The models are able to reproduce within a factor of two the large N(HeI)\/N(HI) ratio together with the mean column densities of the heavy element species observed in the z=2 systems. The density contrast between low and high density regions is of the order of 30. Although the [O\/C] abundance ratio seems slighly larger than solar, firm conclusion should await higher spectral resolution data. A break at the HeII ionization limit of a factor of ten is acceptable in the ionizing spectrum. Abundances are found to be about 0.08 solar. This together with other determinations from the literature indicates that there is evolution in the metal content of metal line systems with redshift: [Mg\/H] is slighly below solar at z=0.7 and [C\/H]=0.1-0.01 at z=2. We detect an associated CIV system at z=2.7126 in which there is some evidence for the presence of NeVIII, probably NeVI, NeVII, and possibly SiXII.",

The QOLCE passed substantial validations for reliability, validity, and responsiveness, and it was approved as an epilepsy HRQOL measure. Second, the Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-89) inventory is an epilepsy specific measure for the HRQOL assessment of adults with epilepsy, who are 17 years old and over [3]. This questionnaire was not used in the study of Wildrick et al., but the one developed specifically for that study [4]. I could not find any reference that this measure was psychometrically evaluated or ever again used. Finally, the review omitted to mention the HRQOL in Pediatric Epilepsy Scale [5] and HRQOL Instrument for Children with Epilepsy (HRQL-C-Ep) [6]. The first one is a self-report\/parent measure for the HRQOL assessment of everyday living. Its psychometric properties were not tested. The other one is a self-\/proxyreport measure for children (8–15 years) assessing HRQOL in interpersonal\/social, worries\/concerns, emotional, secrecy, and behavior domains. For this measure were demonstrated good reliability and validity.

Components of the RAS, including angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzymes, and Ang receptors, are expressed in various nuclei located between the anteroventral region of the third ventricle (AV3V) and the brain stem.1,2 Accordingly, formation of the various Ang peptides, notably Ang II and Ang(1-7) can take place in the brain, independently of the endocrine RAS, and participate in the regulation of water intake, salt appetite, cardiac baroreflex and autonomic functions. Upregulation of Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptors in these nuclei has been shown to reduce baroreflex sensitivity and increase sympathetic tone, thus contributing to the development and maintenance of hypertension and heart failure, ultimately leading to end-organ damage.3 On the other hand, treatment with ACE inhibitors and Ang receptor blockers can prevent RAS overactivity and restore a normal cardiovascular function.

Critics of OTA use believe that government interests are not adequately protected under the more relaxed management processes inherent in OTA implementation, maintaining that such processes bypass many of the traditional checks and balances of the acquisition process. Additionally, if an ACTD were not a formal acquisition program but would eventually transition into one, questions remain regarding how issues of funding, requirements, and integration into operational use should be addressed. These issues persist seven years after the beginning of the HAE UAV ACTD. Two issues in particular have yet to be resolved: the relationship of an ACTD program to the traditional acquisition process, and the affordability and integration of Global Hawk into the force structure within the context of an existing U-2 force with known capabilities. For the most part, we believe that the transition of management responsibility from DARPA to the Air Force within the ACTD program was not significantly affected by the innovative acquisition strategy used in the HAE UAV ACTD program. In fact, the program plan both called for and made provision for that management change.

        "tahun_terbit":1999,
        "abstrak":"BACKGROUND\nIn countries where living donors are the only source of liver grafts, restrictions on graft size are a serious obstacle for the expansion of indications for adult recipients. To overcome this problem, auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplants (APOLT*) was performed on the basis of the concept that the residual native liver would support the graft function until the graft had grown enough to function by itself.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAPOLT as an aid for small-for-size (SFS) grafts was reviewed retrospectively to evaluate its feasibility. Between April 1995 and March 1998, 20 recipients underwent APOLT, which was indicated because of a SFS graft in 15 of them. The indication was based on the estimated graft\/recipient's body weight ratio (GRWR). If the ratio was <0.8%, APOLT was performed. The other 5 patients had a graft with a GRWR >0.8% and underwent APOLT on the basis of the residual native liver supporting the graft function temporarily, 4 for supplementation of the defective enzyme in metabolic liver diseases and one for leaving the potential of the regeneration of the native liver in fulminant hepatic failure. The recipients who underwent APOLT because of a SFS graft were categorized as the SFS group, and the others were the second group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the SFS group, the age of the recipients ranged from 13 to 48 (median 23). The original indications of this group were fulminant hepatic failure in 2 recipients, acute deterioration of chronic liver diseases in 3, Wilson's disease in 2, biliary atresia in 4, primary biliary cirrhosis in 3, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in one. The actual GRWR ranged from 0.45 to 0.72 (median 0.55). The graft was implanted after resection of the left lateral segment of the native liver. Except in the first two patients, the portal vein to the residual native liver was completely transected so that all of the portal blood drained into the graft liver. This procedure was successful in 9 patients. The cause of death in the other 6 was mainly infection. The mortality rate among the recipients with signs of advanced liver failure, such as massive ascites or hepatic coma, was higher, even though APOLT was used to support the SFS graft. In the second group, in the other five recipients who underwent APOLT for other indications, one recipient with fulminant hepatic failure died of sepsis caused by the dehiscence of bilio-enteric anastomosis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAPOLT as an aid for a SFS graft is technically viable. This procedure can thus expand the indication of living donor liver transplants for adult recipients when the native liver retains some functional capability to support the grafted liver during the immediate postoperative period.",

The one-pot reaction between ScCl(3) and [Me2Si(C5Me4)(NC6H2Me3-2,4,6)]Li2 followed by reaction with LiCH2C6H4NMe2-o in THF gave the scandium analogue [{Me2Si(C5Me4)(NC6H2Me3-2,4,6)}Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2-o)] (2-Sc) in 67 % isolated yield. 2-Sc could not be prepared by the acid-base reaction between [Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2-o)3] and (C5Me4H)SiMe2NH(C6H2Me3-2,4,6). These half-sandwich rare-earth metal aminobenzyl complexes can serve as efficient catalyst precursors for the catalytic addition of various phosphine P--H bonds to carbodiimides to form a series of phosphaguanidine derivatives with excellent tolerability to aromatic carbon-halogen bonds. A significant increase in the catalytic activity was observed, as a result of an increase in the metal size with a general trend of La>Pr, Nd>Sm>Gd>Lu>Sc. The reaction of 2-La with 1 equiv of Ph2PH yielded the corresponding phosphide complex [{Me2Si(C5Me4)(NC6H2Me3-2,4,6)}La(PPh2)(thf)2] (4), which, on recrystallization from benzene, gave the dimeric analogue [{Me2Si(C5Me4)(NC6H2Me3-2,4,6)}La(PPh2)]2 (5). Addition of 4 or 5 to iPrN=C=NiPr in THF yielded the phosphaguanidinate complex [{Me2Si(C5Me4)(NC6H2Me3-2,4,6)}La{iPrNC(PPh2)NiPr}(thf)] (6), which, on recrystallization from ether, afforded the ether-coordinated structurally characterizable analogue [{Me2Si(C5Me4)(NC6H2Me3-2,4,6)}La{iPrNC(PPh2)NiPr}(OEt2)] (7). The reaction of 6 or 7 with Ph2PH in THF yielded 4 and the phosphaguanidine iPrN=C(PPh2)NHiPr (3a). These results suggest that the catalytic formation of a phosphaguanidine compound proceeds through the nucleophilic addition of a phosphide species, which is formed by the acid-base reaction between a rare-earth metal o-dimethylaminobenzyl bond and a phosphine P--H bond, to a carbodiimide, followed by the protonolysis of the resultant phosphaguanidinate species by a phosphine P--H bond.

        "abstrak":"Problems of residual stress analysis can be formulated in terms of so-called eigenstrain or inelastic strain. Although the concept is almost 100 year old, the use of it by the residual stress community is quite limited, due to complexities of the associated mathematics. When mathematical difficulties are resolved and eigenstrain is reconstructed, the use of it can be beneficial in several ways. Firstly, the eigenstrain is essentially a generator function for residual elastic stress and elastic strain and it can be used, for generation of any stress field in FE models. Furthermore, eigenstrain distributions are frequently localized, even though the elastic stress or strain distributions are not. Both these properties can be used for effective data reduction. Another advantage of the use of the eigenstrain concept is that experimental data may be interpreted in a more meaningful way by using a narrower context, in terms of plastic deformation, thermal expansion\/misfit and deformation caused by phase transformation, rather than just residual stress\/strain field. The sample geometry and symmetry play an important role in resolving eigenstrain distributions from residual stress and elastic strain fields. Generally the equations are difficult to solve, however for a sample geometry of high symmetry, eigenstrain can be resolved and expressed as a solution of a relatively simple integral equation; which is the Fredholm of the second type with the kernel of the integral operator defined by the sample geometry\/symmetry. Several such symmetries are investigated, yielding analytical solutions that are applied and contrasted to experimental data. An important issue for residual stress analysis is the uniqueness of the solution is also discussed.",

Although, the commercial use of molecular breast imaging (MBI) is not available currently in our country, it has widely been adopted for breast cancer screening in other countries [2]. Supplemental use of MBI in mammographically dense breasts at reduced radiation dose was reported to yield the cancer detection rate [3]. As the author pointed out, we agree that MBI may be favorable if considering radiation exposure to breast and cost per examination. However, to clarify the true difference of imaging sensitivity, because the 2 % difference is too small, direct comparative study between MBI and PEM is needed. We believe that the advantage of PEM is its higher spatial resolution, provided by 12 images per 1 scan, and the semiquantative analysis. Both MBI and PEM have shown variable levels of background uptakes, which can lead misinterpretations. The semiquantative analysis of PEM is useful to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in such cases [3]. Another advantage of PEM is that PET(\/CT) scans can be taken without adding another FDG. Opportunistic cancer screening using FDG-PET is widely spread in our country. The cancer detection rate is reported 1.14 % [4]. We hope that further studies are needed to clarify the adequate use of MBI and PEM.",

        "tahun_terbit":2010,
        "abstrak":"Abstract: Using the National Standards' 5 C's as a framework, the authors examine student success in Spanish community service-learning at making connections across academic disciplines, to information and viewpoints that they encounter in the community, and to concrete social action. We use data from students, instructors, and community partners involved in a community service-learning Spanish course to present three cases: a student who made connections and took action, another who could not make connections beyond her own experience vis-a-vis the concept of poverty, and one representative case of a student who excelled as a student in every traditional context yet did not take action. Key words: Spanish, civic engagement, community-based learning, connections standard, service learning, social action Introduction At the beginning of the 2006 spring semester, most students in our Spanish course on social entrepreneurship were anxious about the community service-learning (CSL) component. Simple things loomed large in their minds: How to get from campus to the community partner organization, what to wear, what to do if they did not know a certain word in Spanish, and how to answer the phone. But by the end of the semester, most students exhibited increased comfort and confidence in their CSL work. In fact, during the next-to-last week of the semester, we asked students \"Como piensas concluir esta experiencia trabajando en la comunidad? [How do you plan to conclude this experience of working in the community?],\" and their written answers revealed a desire to continue their work in the community after the semester ended. Their plans ranged from \"visiting\" their community partner in the future, to summertime work with their community partner, to more of a lifestyle change: \"No lo considero como una conclusion, pero como un comienzo. Esta fue mi primera experiencia trabajar en la comunidad hispanica y planeo continuar . . . . Me encanto mi tiempo al Centro y tengo muchas gracias [sic] por la oportunidad [de] usar mi espanol y aprender ma s [I do not consider it a conclusion, but a beginning. This was my first experience working in the Hispanic community and I plan to continue. I loved my time at the Center and I am grateful for the opportunity to use my Spanish and learn more].\" This article describes a case in which this connection to concrete social action was indeed made and details steps to foster such connections in other CSL courses. Review of Literature Spanish CSL and the Standards for Foreign Language Learning Anecdotal follow-up with our students has shown that intentions rarely translate into actions when they are not fulfilling a course requirement. Our students have been consistently successful at CSL, according to Zlotkowski's (1998, p. 3) widely accepted definition of CSLF\"meaningful community service that is linked to students' academic experience through related course materials and reflective activities.\" In our experience, it is common for students to express a desire to continue with their work in the community after the course has ended, which coincides with studies that connect CSL to \"a heightened sense of civic responsibility\" (Astin, Vogelgesang, Ikeda, & Yee, 2000, p. 3) or \"intended future service\" (Metz, McLellan, & Youniss, 2003, p. 199). However, most students do not continue working with their community partners after the course ends. Throughout the United States, there are significant Latino populations that allow for partnerships among Spanish language classrooms and community organizations that serve a Latino client base. While all language instructors strive to implement the five goal areas of the Standards for Foreign Language Learning, also called the 5 C's, no conclusions have been reached as to the effectiveness of the traditional classroom environment for the teaching of four of these areas: Communication, Cultures, Connections, and Comparisons (Allen, 2002; Jeffries, 1996; Kadish, 2000; Savignon & Sysoyev, 2005). …",

The practice guideline recommends that parents be advised and reassured, but also stresses that parents' concerns be considered as potential predictors of serious illness. Missed urinary tract infections can be a serious cause of fever. Therefore, urine should be examined in children younger than 2 years who are feverish with no apparent cause.

Yeast identification was done by amplification and sequencing D1\/D2 domain of the gene 26S rDNA. A total of 21 yeast isolates were obtained from both sites and only 8 of them were able to ferment glucose. All 9 isolates fermented coffee pulp waste to ethanol at varying levels. Highest ethanol production was observed by isolate M4, which produced 3% (v\/v) ethanol, followed by PDA4MB (2.8% v\/v), PDA3 (2.6% v\/v) and the least was by M2 which produced only 1.1% (v\/v). Three isolates showed good attribute to ethanol production (2.76 to 3.56% v\/v) even after an addition of higher sugar concentrations to coffee pulp waste. The basic local alignment search t ool (BLAST) and phylogenetic analysis revealed the identity of the yeasts as Pichia kudriavzevii, Issatchenkia orientalis, Clavispora lusitaniae, Pichia guilliermondii, and Pichia anomala, all of them known to be associated with ethanol fermentation.

The current PhD thesis, contributes exactly to this field: to the study of plastic changes in time frame of 6 hours with consecutive Magnetoencephalographic measurements every hour. The inspiration for the protocol came from the finger webbing paradigm first employed to study adult human representational plasticity. In this paradigm of finger webbing, 4 fingers are temporarily webbed together, hence modifying their sensory feedback, for about 6 hours. We used Magnetoencephalography, a non invasive technique to study magnetic fields of the human brain, in order to measure changes in the hand representation in SI, before, during, and after finger webbing for this time frame of 6 hours. Cortical sources representing the index and little finger were localized using electric current stimulation and with the Equivalent Current Dipole method for all the recording sessions. Our results showed a decrease in the Euclidean distance (ED) between the cortical sources of the index and small finger 30 min after webbing, followed by an increase lasting for about 2 h after webbing, which was followed by a return toward baseline values. These results provide a unique frame in which the different representational changes occur, merging previous findings that were only apparently controversial, in which either increases or decreases in ED were reported after sensory manipulation for relatively long or short duration, respectively. Moreover, these observations further confirm that the mechanisms that underlie cortical reorganization are extremely rapid in their expression and, for the first time, show how brain reorganization occurs over time.",

While the first set of interview data captures students’ attitudes towards Zulu and English at UKZN more generally, the second set of interview data includes perceptions towards UKZN's language policy. This policy will introduce Zulu as a compulsory subject for all undergraduate students starting from 2014, and aims to develop this language as the language of learning and teaching (LoLT).

        "abstrak":"Abstract In a recent study, we attempted to confer a tumor-selective cytotoxic activity to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (M-β-CyD), we synthesized folate-conjugated M-β-CyD (FA-M-β-CyD), and demonstrated the potential of FA-M-β-CyD as a novel anticancer agent at a high dose. In the present study, to expand the application of FA-M-β-CyD for cancer chemotherapy, we evaluated the potential of FA-M-β-CyD as a tumor-targeting anticancer drug carrier at a low dose. FA-M-β-CyD formed an inclusion complex with doxorubicin (DOX) with a high-stability constant (3.0 × 105 M−1). Antitumor activity of DOX was increased by the complexation with FA-M-β-CyD, but not with folate-conjugated β-CyD (FA-β-CyD) or M-β-CyD in KB cells, a folate receptor-α (FR-α)-expressing cell line. Also, FA-M-β-CyD increased antitumor activity of paclitaxel, a class IV compound in the biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS), but not 5-fluorouracil, a class III compound in the BCS. Furthermore, FA-M-β-CyD enhanced cellular uptake of DOX through a complexation in KB cells (FR-α (+)), compared to FA-β-CyD and M-β-CyD. The DOX\/FA-M-β-CyD complex showed markedly high antitumor activity, compared to DOX alone and DOX\/M-β-CyD complex, after an intravenous administration to FR-α-expressing tumor cell-bearing mice. These findings suggest that FA-M-β-CyD could be useful as a tumor-selective carrier for anticancer drugs.",

        "abstrak":"The nonclassic form of adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH) has been increasingly recognized in adolescent or adult hyperandrogenic patients. It is now widely accepted that neither the clinical presentation nor the androgen plasma levels can be used for the screening or diagnosis of NCAH in hyperandrogenic women, especially those presenting with a phenotype like that in polycystic ovary syndrome. Therefore, the measurement of a follicular morning level of serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-HP) should be included in the initial investigation of all hyperandrogenic women, including those with premature pubarche. Levels of 17-HP lower than 2 ng\/mL (6.0 nmol\/L) and greater than 4 ng\/mL (12.0 nmol\/L) have good predictive negative and positive values, respectively. The adrenocorticotropic hormone test is useful only when the morning follicular unsuppressed 17-HP level falls between 2 and 4 ng\/mL (6 to 12 nmol\/L). Adrenal insufficiency and adrenal hyperplasia are more theoretical than real complications of NCAH. On the other hand, the polycystic ovary syndrome and infertility are frequently associated with NCAH. For the treatment of hyperandrogenism, the conventional treatment by glucocorticoid therapy is challenged by cyproterone acetate, but it is still indicated when patients wish a pregnancy. It can be questioned whether the low risk of virilized female newborns in untreated women with NCAH justifies prenatal diagnosis and treatment.",

        "tahun_terbit":2005,
        "abstrak":"In the current practice of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) using logic trees, it is common to use the mean hazard curve to determine ground motions for engineering design. We present the case against the use of the mean hazard curve and explain why this practice should be discontinued and, where necessary, removed from regulations. The identification and quantification of uncertainties is integral to modern seismic hazard analysis. In probabilistic seismic hazard studies, the variability of the earthquake magnitude, earthquake location, and ground motion level (expressed as the number of logarithmic standard deviations above the logarithmic mean) are considered explicitly in the computation of the hazard. In major seismic hazard projects, the scientific uncertainty in the models of the distributions of earthquake magnitude, location, and ground motion are also considered using logic trees (Kulkarni et al. 1984, Coppersmith and Youngs 1986, Reiter 1990, Bommer et al. 2005). The inherent variability considered directly in the hazard computation is called the aleatory variability, and the scientific uncertainty in the models of the earthquake occurrence and ground motion is called the epistemic uncertainty. The terms randomness and uncertainty have also been used for aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty, respectively; however, the former terms are now commonly used interchangeably. As a result, they are often mixed up when used in hazard analysis. The terms ‘‘aleatory variability’’ and ‘‘epistemic uncertainty’’ are used to provide an unambiguous terminology. This is not simply semantics: distinguishing between the two types of uncertainty is fundamental to the way that they are dealt with in the hazard calculations and how uncertainty is handled in decision making on the basis of the hazard analysis. In application, the key difference is that aleatory variability leads to the shape of the hazard curve and the epistemic uncertainty leads to alternative hazard curves. There is no dilemma regarding the inclusion of the aleatory variability in the hazard calculations, particularly the variability associated with ground-motion prediction equations: a ‘‘hazard curve’’ calculated using only median values from the equations and neglecting the standard deviation has little meaning and cannot be considered a genuine hazard curve. The hazard analyst does, however, have control over the branches of the logic tree and the weights assigned to these, and hence over the degree to which epistemic uncer",

        "abstrak":"OBJECTIVE\nAcquiring contemporary data on prevalence and natural history of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is essential in the effort to optimise modern screening programmes. The primary aim of this study was to determine the fate of a 65-year-old male population 5 years following an invitation to an aortic ultrasound (US) examination.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this population-based cohort-study, men were invited to US examination at age 65, and were re-invited at age 70. Mortality, AAA repair, and risk factors were recorded. An AAA was defined as a diameter ≥30 mm, and a sub-aneurysmal aorta as 25-29 mm.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 2006-2007, 3,268 65-year-old men were invited, and 2,736 (83.7%) were examined. After 5 years, 24 had completed AAA repair (6 died within 0-4 years), an additional 239 had died, and 194 had moved. Thus, 2,811 70-year-old men were re-invited, and 2,247 (79.9%) were examined. The AAA prevalence increased from 1.5% at 65 to 2.4% (95% CI: 1.8 to 3.0) at 70, and of sub-aneurysmal aortas from 1.7% at 65 to 2.6% (2.0 to 3.3), at 70. Of 2,041 with <25 mm at 65, 0.7% had an AAA at 70. Of 40 with a sub-aneurysmal aorta at 65, 52.5% progressed to AAA at 70. In a Cox regression analysis, sub-aneurysmal aorta at 65 (hazard ratio [HR] 59.78) and smoking (HR 2.78) were independent risk factors for AAA formation. Among 44 with AAA at 65, 22 completed AAA repair with no 30-day mortality.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAAA screening in a contemporary setting was safe at 5 years, with a single AAA rupture observed among non-attenders. Men with a screening detected AAA had a high repair rate and high non-AAA related mortality. AAA-formation was common among men with sub-aneurysmal dilatation, indicating a possible need for surveillance of this group.",

Heubach University of Georgia There have been a number of studies of the questions which teachers ask or should ask, but few, 1: any, of the questions which the children themselves are asking. We know that if children are active mentally, they will be asking questions, for curiosity is one of the strongest elements in the child's life, and the ability to keep alive this spirit of inquiry is one of the strongest tests of the teacher's success. (Thompson, 1924, p. 347). This 1924 assessment of the importance of student questioning and the paucity of research is a recurring theme in the educational literature. In 1942. Fahey reported that \"[Wespite frequent assertions of the value of pupil questioning in the learning process and the comparative abundance of studies dealing with young children, the number of scientific reports involving questioning in the classroom is very small\" (p. 345). More recently, in a review of the questioning literature, Carlsen (1991) acknowledged that student questioning in the classroom and studies of student questions are rare in comparison to studies of the effect of teacher questioning on student learning. The research on student questioning and reading has focussed on: (a) comprehension questions that seek information from others (teacher or classmates); and (b) self-monitoring questions used to check on one's comprehension and understanding (Bean, 1985). Primarily the emphasis has been on training or instructing students to ask the kind of questions that lead to improved scores on measures of reading comprehension (e.g., Palincsar and Brown, 1984). This emphasis does not reflect a child-centered approach to questioning because it undervalues \"questions which may arise in the mind of a boy or girl in conversing with others or in reading books\" (Dewey, 1944, p. 155). The lack of research on children's questions is curious given the recurrence of studentcentered approaches to teaching throughout the history of U. S. education (Cuban, 1984). Given that t' e field of reading (or more broadly, literacy) has been experiencing a renewed and gr6wing interest in studentcentered learning, it is timely to consider research on student questioning. Recently, in an interview on literacy as inquiry, Jerome Harste, suggested that we view reading as",

The growth of the excess pore water pressure of saturated sand is dependent on several factors. Changing the inclination and magnitude of the major principal stress with respect to the depositional direction in most cases will increase the collapse potential and brittleness as well as reduce the shear strength and shear stiffness. An experimental program was carried out to study the variation of pore water pressure of cross-anisotropic deposits under anisotropic cyclic loading. A total of 30 undrained cyclic tests were performed at a constant mean confining stress, σ0m, constant intermediate principal stress ratios, as indicated by b= (σ2-σ3)\/(σ1-σ3), and principal stress directions, α. The experiments were performed on hollow cylinder specimens prepared by moist under compaction technique; with a height of 20cm, outer diameter of 10cm, and a wall thickness of 2cm. The applicability of an empirical model for predicting pore water pressure generation in clean sand during anisotropic cyclic loading has been studied. Results showed that inclination of the major principal stress with respect to the depositional direction had no significant effect on the residual pore water pressure.

Quite distinct from its traditional use in the dairy industries, L. lactis has emerged as a potential delivery vector for various antigens as well as therapeutic and immunomodulatory proteins. Many recent studies have shown promising results using in vitro or animal models. In addition, the oral administration of human interleukin 10 (hIL-10)-secreting L. lactis for the management and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been the subject of recent clinical trials. These trials represent the first steps for the use of genetically modified L. lactis in clinical practice. In the present review we discuss some of the recent studies which investigate the use of L. lactis as an in vivo protein delivery system. The concept of biological containment in L. lactis using pyrimidine synthesis knock-out systems is also discussed. Finally we describe recent work evaluating living versus dead L. lactis vectors with particular emphasis on the use of Gram-positive Enhancer Matrix (GEM) particles as a novel delivery system.",

ABSTRACT TRPA1 is an ion channel of the TRP family that is expressed in some sensory neurons. TRPA1 activity provokes sensory symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as pain and paraesthesia. We have used a grease gap method to record axonal membrane potential and evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) in vitro from human sural nerves and studied the effects of mustard oil (MO), a selective activator of TRPA1. Surprisingly, we failed to demonstrate any depolarizing response to MO (50, 250 &mgr;M) in any human sural nerves. There was no effect of MO on the A wave of the ECAP, but the C wave was reduced at 250 &mgr;M. In rat saphenous nerve fibres MO (50, 250 &mgr;M) depolarized axons and reduced the C wave of the ECAP but had no effect on the A wave. By contrast, both human and rat nerves were depolarized by capsaicin (0.5 to 5 &mgr;M) or nicotine (50 to 200 &mgr;M). Capsaicin caused a profound reduction in C fibre conduction in both species but had no effect on the amplitude of the A component. Lidocaine (30 mM) depolarized rat saphenous nerves acutely, and when rat nerves were pretreated with 30 mM lidocaine to mimic the exposure of human nerves to local anaesthetic during surgery, the effects of MO were abolished whilst the effects of capsaicin were unchanged. This study demonstrates that the local anaesthetic lidocaine desensitizes TRPA1 ion channels and indicates that it may have additional mechanisms for treating neuropathic pain that endure beyond simple sodium channel blockade.",

        "abstrak":"Abstract Pinning effect of second-phase particles has been demonstrated as an extremely effective way to impede grain boundary (GB) migration to increase strength or thermal stability, particularly for nano-scale materials. Previous studies on the particle pinning mainly focus on the incoherent particle; the coherent particle pinning, more effective in retarding the GB migration, has not yet been completely understood, owing to varied phase boundary (PB) energy essentially and additionally considered. In this paper, the maximum and the average pinning forces of the coherent particle are modeled, considering the evolved GB shape. A critical criterion is deduced to judge the condition that the pinning force from multiple particle can be obtained by a linear summation of the pinning force from the individual particle. Using Cu–Ag as the model system, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to study the interaction between the coherent Ag particles and the planar Cu GBs, where the maximum and the average pinning forces are estimated as functions of particle parameters (e.g. the size, the volume fraction, the shape and the orientation of particle). By combination of models and MD simulations, the pinning effect of coherent particles is attributed to a change in Gibbs free energy ascribed to the GB energy and the PB energy, while the maximum and the average pinning forces are enhanced with an increase in volume fraction or a decrease in size of particle.",

        "abstrak":"Introduction Let us consider a sessile droplet. If the temperature of the system is higher than the saturation temperature (Tsat) of the liquid the measurement of the equilibrium contact angle becomes very challenging measure with great implication for two-phase flows, boiling phenomena and evaporation processes. Furthermore the equilibrium contact angle close to boiling conditions is an essential input specification for numerical simulations capturing the heterogeneous phase change phenomena. In this paper, we report such experiments recording the evolution of the contact angle (CA) of a sessile drop on the heated surface using a high speed camera (HSC) and an infrared high speed camera (IRC). Several groups have studied the effect of temperature on the equilibrium contact angles experimentally, with direct measurement, or numerically, using molecular dynamic simulation. However there is some disagreement between the authors. The experiments seem to show a reduction of the equilibrium contact angle with the increase of the temperature, for hydrophilic surface. In Aydar et al. [1] contact angles of oils on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with different surface temperature were measured and compared to values predicted by Girifalco-Good-Fowkes-Young (GGFY) equation, that predicts a reduction of contact angle with increase of the temperature. For Petke et al. [2] also on hydrophobic surface the CA should decreases with temperature. Conversely Kandlikar et al. [3] measured the CA during rapid evaporation of liquid on a heated hydrophobic surface and the values of the contact angles for higher temperatures are remarkably constant. On the other hand, molecular dynamic simulations seem to indicate a reduction of the CA with temperature if the surface is hydrophilic and an increase of CA with temperature if the surface is hydrophobic (Becker et al. [4]). Our work focus on the measure of the equilibrium contact angle for sessile droplets on hydrophilic (Aluminium) and hydrophobic (PTFE) surfaces, measuring at the same time the temperature of the droplet and the temperature of the substrate, in order to clarify the influence of temperature on values of the contact angle for both surfaces. Three fluids are used, water, ethanol and isopropanol.",

        "abstrak":"Twenty-one human brain tumor biopsies were processed by mechanical and enzymatic methods to produce mixed cell suspensions. Cultures were prepared in small plastic flasks, and primary outgrowth occurred in 16\/21 cultures. The period required for primary outgrowth ranged from 3 days to 14 days. We established serial propagation with 15\/16 of the primary cultures. Sensitivity to HuIFN-β was determined between passages 3 to 12, using a microassay based on cell viability (uptake of a supravital stain, netural red). Extracted dye was quantified in acidic-methanol using the MR580 Microelisa Autoreader (Dynatech). We observed a broad range of responsiveness to the drug among the 12 cell-strains tested. Thus, 4 cell strains were relatively sensitive; 4 were resistant to 104 IRU\/ml of purified HuIFN-β. Four cell strains exhibited a level of responsiveness that was intermediate to that of these two groups.During propagation of these biopsies, cytopathology suggestive of paramyoxvirus-infection appeared in 4 of the cell-strains. This characteristic was not uniformly associated with high sensitivity to human beta interferon which is a very potent, naturally occurring antiviral substance.Our results support the concept that information concerning sensitivity to HuIFN-β and other cytostatic agents may be rapidly obtained using microcultures of brain tumor cultures in conjunction with supravital stain uptake studies. Additionally, these results suggest that further clinical studies with β interferon should be undertaken to define the parameters which determine successful in vivo application.",

Evidence exists that major depression interacts with physical illness to amplify the functional disability associated with many medical conditions. Methods: We used data from the Canadian Community and Health Survey Cycle 2.1 (n = 46,262), a nationally representative survey conducted in 2003 by Statistics Canada. Depression, chronic conditions, and functional disability were assessed by personal\/telephone interview. Results: Prevalence of functional disability was higher in subjects with chronic conditions and comorbid major depression (46.3%) than in individuals with either chronic conditions (20.9%) or major depression (27.8%) alone. With no chronic conditions and no major depression as reference and after adjusting for relevant covariates, the odds ratio of functional disability was 2.49 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.91–3.26) for major depression, 2.12 (95% CI, 1.93–2.32) for chronic conditions, and 6.34 (95% CI, 5.35–7.51) for chronic conditions and comorbid major depression. Conclusions: The results suggest that there is a joint effect of depression and chronic conditions on functional disability.

        "tahun_terbit":1984,
        "abstrak":"There appears to be a general relationship between abundance and distribution that has two parts. First, within species, population density tends to be greatest in the center of the range and to decline gradually toward the boundaries. This pattern holds over a range of spatial scales from steep environmental gradients within local regions to the entire geographic range. Exceptions include: (1) abrupt changes in abundance that usually correspond to sharp, discontinuous changes in single environmental variables; and (2) multimodal patterns of abundance that are caused by environmental patchiness. The second general relationship is that among closely related, ecologically similar species spatial distribution is positively correlated with average abundance. Again this pattern holds over a variety of spatial scales from local regions to entire geographic ranges. These empirical patterns have already been reported in the literature, but their generality is demonstrated by analysis of additional data for diverse kinds of organisms. A single general theory accounts for these observations and follows logically from three assumptions. First, the abundance and distribution of each species are limited by the combination of physical and biotic environmental variables that determines the multidimensional niche. Second, spatial variation in these environmental variables is somewhat stochastic but autocorrelated, so that nearby sites tend to have more similar environmental conditions than more distant ones. Third, closely related, ecologically similar species differ in no more than a very few niche dimensions. A more formal model can be developed that predicts that under these assumptions the distribution of population density over space should approximate a normal probability density distribution. Most exceptions to this predicted pattern can be explained as cases in which assumptions of the model are clearly violated. This paper represents an example of a statistical approach that should be useful for investigating complex ecological systems comprised of many components, such as species of many individuals or communities of many species. The general relationships between abundance and distribution developed here eventually should contribute to our understanding of the biogeography, population genetics, and evolution of species as well as the ecological attributes of populations and communities.",

To gain information on the possible role of MMPs in choroidal neovascularization (CNV), we have analyzed the mRNA expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, two forms of MMPs implicated in ocular neovascularization, in a rat model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nChoroidal neovascularization was induced in pigmented rats by krypton laser photocoagulation of the fundus whereafter eyes were enucleated at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 60 days. Antisense and sense riboprobes were generated using DNA complementary to MMP-2 and MMP-9, and mRNA expression was analyzed using in situ hybridization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the untreated eyes MMP-2 mRNA expression was weakly detected in cells within the choroid. In laser-treated eyes MMP-2 mRNA expression was markedly increased and mainly localized to macrophage-like and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)-like cells invading the choroid, subretinal space and inner retina. This increase in MMP-2 mRNA expression peaked at day 10 whereafter a decline was detected. MMP-9 mRNA expression was low in untreated eyes and did not increase following laser treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results show that MMP-2 mRNA expression is increased in experimental CNV, and support of a role for MMP-2 in the development of CNV in age-related macular degeneration.",

(maize) rad51 homologs are viable and develop well under normal conditions, but are male sterile and have substantially reduced seed set. Light microscopic analyses of male meiosis in these plants reveal reduced homologous pairing, synapsis of nonhomologous chromosomes, reduced bivalents at diakinesis, numerous chromosome breaks at anaphase I, and that >33% of quartets carry cells that either lack an organized nucleolus or have two nucleoli. This indicates that RAD51 is required for efficient chromosome pairing and its absence results in nonhomologous pairing and synapsis. These phenotypes differ from those of an Arabidopsis rad51 mutant that exhibits completely disrupted chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis. Unexpectedly, surviving female gametes produced by maize rad51 double mutants are euploid and exhibit near-normal rates of meiotic crossovers. The finding that maize rad51 double mutant embryos are extremely susceptible to radiation-induced DSBs demonstrates a conserved role for RAD51 in the repair of mitotic DSBs in plants, vertebrates, and yeast.",

Objective: Our aim was to determine myometrial contractility patterns in fresh hysterectomy specimens from women with endometriosis compared to menorraghia. Our hypothesis was that the myometrium of women with endometriosis would contract with greater force and amplitude than in women with menorrhagia. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective case control study at the Liverpool Womens’ Hospital, United Kingdom. Full thickness hysterectomy specimens were obtained from 15 women with endometriosis (average age =45; 35–49) and 40 women with menorrhagia (average age =44; 32–57) and were subjected to invitro laboratory testing. The force, frequency, duration and amplitude were measured in the laboratory. Contractility force was measured simultaneously with intracellular calcium signalling using fluorescent Indo-1. Results: The frequency of uterine contractility was higher in endometriosis while the amplitude was lower compared to menorrhagia. The amplitude was even lower in women who had several different medical treatments for their endometriosis. Statistical analysis: We used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney Test to compare results and found a statistical difference between amplitude measurements in the endometriosis group compared to the menorrhagia group, p = 0.0081 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Women with endometriosis seem to contract more frequently but with lower amplitude. The frequency of the contractions may explain the associated dysmenorrhea.",

Using the data of YRD cities from 2011–2017, the spatial durbin model (SDM) is presented to investigate how compactness (in terms of urban density, jobs-housing balance, and urban centralization) and poly-centricity (in terms of the number of centers and polycentric cluster) affect PM10 emissions. After controlling some variables, the results suggest that more jobs-housing-balanced and centralized compactness tends to decrease emissions, while poly-centricity by developing too many centers is expected to result in more pollutant emissions. The effect of high-density compactness is more controversial. In addition, for cities with more private car ownerships (>10 million within cities), enhancing the polycentric cluster by achieving a more balanced population distribution between the traditional centers and sub-centers could reduce emissions, whereas this mitigated emissions effect may be limited. The difference between our study and western studies suggests that the correlation between high-density compactness and air pollution vary with the specific characteristics and with spatial planning implications, as this paper concludes.",

It is shown that the thermal impedance R depends strongly on the width w of the ridge and that this effect is different before and after threshold.

Concerning liposarcoma subtypes, evidence of the efficacy of trabectedin for dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) is poor, whereas it is known to have high efficacy against myxoid liposarcoma. Moreover, there are few reports of long-term trabectedin treatment of cases of DDLPS. Here, we present a case of advanced metastatic DDLPS that achieved long-term disease control by trabectedin treatment. Patient concerns: A 68-year-old man presented with a mass in his back. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumorous mass in his back which exhibited low intensity on T1-weighted and high intensity on T2-weighted images. Diagnosis: The mass was diagnosed as DDLPS by open biopsy. Interventions: The patient underwent gemcitabine+docetaxel combination therapy followed by pazopanib and eribulin; all these therapies failed to halt disease progression. Subsequently, we changed the regimen to trabectedin as fourth-line therapy. Outcome: The patient achieved stable disease for approximately 18 months during 11 cycles of trabectedin therapy. Lessons: Trabectedin should be considered as a treatment option for DDLPS even in cases of numerous failed prior chemotherapy regimens.",

Nausea\/vomiting and sedation\/drowsiness are often associated with delayed discharge and readmission. These symptoms are also related to pharmacological treatment as well as dehydration and fasting. The evidence that preoperative fasting and dehydration not only reduces preoperative well being, but may also affect postoperative recovery is currently being reviewed. Recent findings In association with minor surgical procedures, rehydration with approximately 1 l fluid, and in cases with a moderate degree of surgery, such as laparoscopic surgery, 1–3 l fluid, given perioperatively will improve postoperative well being and recovery. Administration of a carbohydrate-rich beverage not only provides fluid but also counteracts the negative effects of preoperative fasting, which in turn reduces preoperative hunger and improves well being. Postoperatively, this treatment reduces insulin resistance, which may be relevant in surgery with significant postoperative stress response. Two studies on laparoscopic cholecystectomy demonstrate different results regarding effects on postoperative outcome and nausea\/vomiting and further evaluation is required. Summary When preoperative dehydration is corrected, postoperative well being and clinical outcome improves. Avoiding preoperative fasting by administration of carbohydrate-rich beverages improves preoperative well being while effects on postoperative recovery in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery need to be further evaluated.",

DESIGN: Logistic regression models were used to examine differences between certified nurse midwife and physician delivered births in infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality, and risk of low birthweight after controlling for a variety of social and medical risk factors. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to examine differences in mean birthweight after controlling for the same risk factors. STUDY SETTING: United States. PATIENTS: The study included all singleton, vaginal births at 35-43 weeks gestation delivered either by physicians or certified nurse midwives in the United States in 1991. MAIN RESULTS: After controlling for social and medical risk factors, the risk of experiencing an infant death was 19% lower for certified nurse midwife attended than for physician attended births, the risk of neonatal mortality was 33% lower, and the risk of delivering a low birthweight infant 31% lower. Mean birthweight was 37 grams heavier for the certified nurse midwife attended than for physician attended births. CONCLUSIONS: National data support the findings of previous local studies that certified nurse midwives have excellent birth outcomes. These findings are discussed in light of differences between certified nurse midwives and physicians in prenatal care and labour and delivery care practices.

The indigenous knowledge of local traditional healers and native plants used by the villagers to cure Diabetes were collected using a questionnaire and personal interviews. Total 30 villagers in the age group of 30-68 years were interviewed out of which 3 were local healers. The investigation reveals 35 species of plants belonging to 28 families which are used to cure Diabetes. It is found that the whole plant is used for curing the ailment but mostly fresh juice, powder, fresh leaves, paste or decoction in water remains the most preferred method of preparation. Most plants are very effective remedy when used in a combination or singly. The present study throws light on the traditional knowledge of the villagers regarding medicinal plant which can be used against Diabetes which is largely unexplored. INTRODUCTION: The North east region of India comprising of the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Nagaland and Sikkim can be physiologically categorised into the Eastern Himalayas, Northeast hills and the Brahmaputra and Barak Valley plains. At the confluence of the Indo Malayan, Indo Chinese and Indian biogeographical realms, the northeast region is unique in providing a profusion of habitats, which features diverse biota with a high level of endemism. The region is also abode of approximately 225 tribes in India out of 450 in the country, the culture and customs of which have an important role in understanding biodiversity conservation and management issues . The state of Assam with an area of 78,520 sq. km, located in the North Eastern region of India has rich wealth of flora and fauna due to its characteristic geographical location and varied climate. According to 1991 census, the total population of the state is 22,414,322 out of which 11.09 per cent are urban and 88.89 per cent are rural inhabitants. The state of Assam is divided into 23 districts . This is a mixing ground of more than 100 tribes and sub-tribes of both hills and plains, having different ethnic and linguistic background. These tribal groups have accumulated a treasure of traditional knowledge about many uses and benefits of locally available plants. The diverse flora in this region provides a rich source of medicinal plants which is being used by them in their folk medicine.",

In the absence of electric fields the Bloch electron Hamiltonian changes the Berry curvature, the effective magnetic field, and the damping in the dynamical equation of the magnetization, which we classify into intrinsic and extrinsic effects. Static electric fields modify these as first-order perturbations, using which we were able to give a physically clear interpretation of the current-induced spin-orbit torques. We used a toy model mimicking a ferromagnet-topological-insulator interface to illustrate the various effects, and predicted an anisotropic gyromagnetic ratio and the dynamical stability for an in-plane magnetization. Our formalism can also be applied to the slow dynamics of other order parameters in crystalline solids.",

This leads to the question: how can we reproduce the results of a randomized log space computation without storing the output or randomness verbatim? Running the algorithm again with new random bits may result in a new (and potentially different) output. \nWe show that every problem in search-RL has a randomized log-space algorithm where the output can be reproduced. Specifically, we show that for every problem in search-RL, there are a pair of log-space randomized algorithms A and B where for every input x, A will output some string t_x of size O(log n), such that B when running on (x, t_x) will be pseudo-deterministic: that is, running B multiple times on the same input (x, t_x) will result in the same output on all executions with high probability. Thus, by storing only O(log n) bits in memory, it is possible to reproduce the output of a randomized log-space algorithm. \nAn algorithm is reproducible without storing any bits in memory (i.e., |t_x|=0) if and only if it is pseudo-deterministic. We show pseudo-deterministic algorithms for finding paths in undirected graphs and Eulerian graphs using logarithmic space. Our algorithms are substantially faster than the best known deterministic algorithms for finding paths in such graphs in log-space. \nThe algorithm for search-RL has the additional property that its output, when viewed as a random variable depending on the randomness used by the algorithm, has entropy O(log n).",

However, a substantial number of ischemic strokes in NVAF patients are related to non-CE mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the non-CE risk factors in ischemic stroke patients had NVAF. Methods We included 401 patients (65.6% male, 68.6 ± 9.6 years old) who had been hospitalized due to ischemic stroke and had a known or newly diagnosed NVAF. The CE (intracardiac thrombus, dense spontaneous echo contrast, or low left atrial appendage flow velocity) and non-CE (complex aortic plaque, significant carotid stenosis, or intracranial arterial stenosis) risk factors were investigated at the time of the index stroke. Results The number of CE and non-CE risk factors increased with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc scores (p for trends < 0.001). The presence of CE risk factors was independently associated with persistent atrial fibrillation (p < 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.003), heart failure (p = 0.003), and left atrial volume index (p < 0.001). In contrast, the presence of non-CE risk factors was independently associated with age (p < 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.049), diabetes (p = 0.030), and coronary artery calcium score (CACS; p < 0.001). CACS had the added value in predicting non-CE risk factors of ischemic stroke regardless of the CHA2DS2-VASc risk category (p < 0.001). Conclusion Non-CE risk factors in ischemic stroke patients with NVAF are associated with high CHA2DS2-VASc score and CACS. Atherosclerotic non-CE risk factors should be considered as potential mechanisms of stroke even in patients with AF-associated ischemic stroke.",

When many pieces of information are spreading and competing in the space of social media messages, their propagation rates become very unequal. This is because contagion creates a positive feedback which amplifies small, random differences in prevalence. A framework for modeling social media is developed that suggests how to infer the communication choices of social media participants from the observed heavy-tailed count distribution of messages containing different pieces of information. In a Monte Carlo simulation where agents with rational expectations make individually optimal communication choices, the feedback effect is only partially mitigated. Even with fully rational behavior, information that no-one has an especially high propensity to pass along can “go viral”. CHAPTER 2: SEARCH AND BARGAINING WITH PLASTIC: MONEY AND CHARGE CARDS AS COMPETING MEDIA OF EXCHANGE Charge cards are introduced into the Lagos-Wright money search model as an alternative medium of exchange competing with money. I explore why cards and money may coexist, and examine the implications of intermediated exchange for monetary policy. Charge cards lower the social cost of inflation because they overcome the hold up problem with money that otherwise results in too little exchange. Some inflation can even be beneficial if a higher cost of holding money pushes agents to become cardholders. Moreover, higher nominal interest rates help card companies set higher spending limits, which can also increase the level of exchange and improve welfare.

What this policy concerned most often changed according to the situation. Generally speaking, the governors put emphasis on valuing agriculture above commerce in the early West-Han Dynasty and on restraining annexation of land in the late West-Han Dynasty. The aim of the government was to prevent the powerful and wealthy landlords from overly developing in the East-Han Dynasty.

Here we test whether these rostral ventrolateral medullary catecholaminergic (RVLM-CA) neurons use glutamate as a transmitter in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). After injecting Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV2) DIO-Ef1α-channelrhodopsin2(ChR2)-mCherry (AAV2) into the RVLM of dopamine-β-hydroxylase Cre transgenic mice (DβHCre\/0), mCherry was detected exclusively in RVLM-CA neurons. Within the DMV >95% mCherry-immunoreactive(ir) axonal varicosities were tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-ir and the same proportion were vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2)-ir. VGLUT2-mCherry colocalization was virtually absent when AAV2 was injected into the RVLM of DβHCre\/0;VGLUT2flox\/flox mice, into the caudal VLM (A1 noradrenergic neuron-rich region) of DβHCre\/0 mice or into the raphe of ePetCre\/0 mice. Following injection of AAV2 into RVLM of TH-Cre rats, phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase and VGLUT2 immunoreactivities were highly colocalized in DMV within EYFP-positive or EYFP-negative axonal varicosities. Ultrastructurally, mCherry terminals from RVLM-CA neurons in DβHCre\/0 mice made predominantly asymmetric synapses with choline acetyl-transferase-ir DMV neurons. Photostimulation of ChR2-positive axons in DβHCre\/0 mouse brain slices produced EPSCs in 71% of tested DMV preganglionic neurons (PGNs) but no IPSCs. Photostimulation (20 Hz) activated PGNs up to 8 spikes\/s (current-clamp). EPSCs were eliminated by tetrodotoxin, reinstated by 4-aminopyridine, and blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor blockers. In conclusion, VGLUT2 is expressed by RVLM-CA (C1) neurons in rats and mice regardless of the presence of AAV2, the C1 neurons activate DMV parasympathetic PGNs monosynaptically and this connection uses glutamate as an ionotropic transmitter.",

This paper contributes to tackle this problem enhancing the previously proposed Active Learning image segmentation system with Domain Knowledge. Active Learning iterates the following process: first, a classifier is trained on the basis of a set of image features extrated for each training labeled voxel; second, a human operator is presented with the most uncertain unlabeled voxels to select some of them for inclusion in the training set assigining corresponding label. Finally, image segmentation is produced by voxel classification of the entire volume with the resulting classifier. The approach has been applied to the segmentation of the thrombus in CTA data of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) patients. The Domain Knowledge referring to the expected shape of the target structures is used to filter out undesired region detections in a post-processing step. We report computational experiments over 6 abdominal CTA datasets consisting. The performance measure is the true positive rate (TPR). Surface rendering provides a 3D visualization of the segmented thrombus. A few Active Learning iterations achieve accurate segmentation in areas where it is difficult to distinguish the anatomical structures due to noise conditions and similarity of gray levels between the thrombus and other structures.",

Through in vivo culture, low dose Ce3+ promoted, but higher dose Ce3+, restrained mitochondrial heat production. However, through vitro incubation, Ce3+ showed only inhibitory action on mitochondrial energy turnover, the concentration required for 50% inhibition being 46.7 μM. In addition, Ce3+, like Ca2+, induced rice mitochondrial swelling and decreased membrane potential (△ψ), which was inhibited by the specific permeability transition inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA). The induction approached a constant level while mitochondrial metabolism was fully prevented by Ce3+. These results demonstrated that cerium influenced rice mitochondria in vivo and in vitro via different action pathways, and the latter involved the opening of rice mitochondrial permeability.",

The selection of the design approach for the switching regulator is presented, together with an analysis of its operation and definition of its characteristics, functional performance, and test results. The regulator transforms a variable voltage input to a constant average voltage by constant-frequency pulse width modulation. Two major advantages are high efficiency and essentially constant thermal dissipation over a wide range of input power. The boost configuration employs a power transformer and transistor switches to handle only boost power. This method significantly reduces the RF interference generated in switching as compared to other series-switching regulation techniques, for voltage step-up, or step-down. The RF interference (RFI) inherent in the use of a switching regulator presented a major problem. The circuit elements, mode of regulation, and packaging arrangement were all developed to minimize RFI with the least sacrifice of performance.",

In the absence of TAG-1, axonal Caspr2 did not accumulate at juxtaparanodes, and the normal enrichment of shaker-type K+ channels in these regions was severely disrupted, in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In contrast, the localization of protein 4.1B, an axoplasmic partner of Caspr2, was only moderately altered. TAG-1, which is expressed in both neurons and glia, was able to associate in cis with Caspr2 and in trans with itself. Thus, a tripartite intercellular protein complex, comprised of these two proteins, appears critical for axo–glial contacts at juxtaparanodes. This complex is analogous to that described previously at paranodes, suggesting that similar molecules are crucial for different types of axo–glial interactions.",

Distinguishing between usual care and research procedures is important for determining if training is required of community-based personnel. The use of research assistants or practice facilitators to collect research-related information is one way of limiting practice involvement to usual care procedures, thereby allowing PBRNs to limit training to dedicated research staff. Key methodologies for human subject protection training of community practice staff include on-site lectures, online modules, videotapes, and paper-based training.

The basic ideas of this approach are as follows: (1) the sound transmission loss (TL) analysis of a plate with arbitrary boundary conditions is conducted by the coupled FEM-BEM method; (2) the single-number rating method (such as low frequency sound transmission class) is used to assess the plate’s overall LFS insulation; and (3) the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed for searching the optimal solutions of the multiple-parameter optimization problem.

She earned her Ph.D. in Canadian history \n and the African Diaspora with a focus on the Black communities of 19th century Ontario. \n Her doctoral dissertation was a biography of Henry Bibb, the renowned antislavery \n crusader. Further, she has done extensive work on Mary Bibb as a schoolteacher and \n abolitionist reformer. Afua has also done ground-breaking work on the enslavement \n of Black people in Canada. Such research has resulted in The Hanging of Angelique: \n The Untold Story of Slavery in Canada and the Burning of Old Montreal (HarperCollins, \n 2006); released in the United States by the University of Georgia Press. The French \n language version was published by L’Editions de L’Homme in 2007. Angelique has become \n a national bestseller and was nominated for the Governor General’s Award in 2006. \n Angelique has now gone in its third printing, and after almost two years of publication \n is still on the Canadian bestseller’s list as of 23 Nov. 2007. Dr. Cooper’s work on \n Canadian Black history and slavery has made her the leading authority on such topics. \n Afua is also a well-known poet, having published five books of poetry, the latest \n of which is Copper Woman and Other Poems (Natural Heritage Press, 2006). In 2007 Dr. \n Cooper served as the co-ordinator of and advisor to the Ontario Bicentenary of the \n Abolition of the British Slave Trade Initiative for the Government of Ontario. Afua \n is currently the Ruth Wynn Woodward Endowed Chair in the Women’s Studies Department \n at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia. \n Afua is a dynamic and riveting performer. She has brought her poetry from page to \n stage in such diverse events as the prestigious Toronto Harbourfront International \n Reading Series, and Diaspora Dialogues. She has read all across Canada, the Caribbean, \n the UK, the United States, and West Africa. Known as a proponent of the African-Caribbean \n poetry genre, Dub poetry, Afua has fused together the scribal, literary, musical, \n and performative aspects of that artform in her performances. Cooper has worked with \n such bands as the Gayap Drummers, Juno award winner, Lazo and the Radicals; she now \n tours with the Dub Trinity Band. Further, she co-hosted and organized three international \n Dub Poetry Festivals in Toronto (1993, 2004, and 2005). \n Afua holds a Ph.D. in history with specialties in slavery, abolition, and women studies. \n She is one of Canada’s premier experts and chroniclers of the country’s Black past. \n Dr. Cooper has done ground-breaking work in uncovering the hidden history of Black \n peoples in Canada. Her most recent history publication The Hanging of Angelique, The \n Untold Story of Canadian Slavery and the Burning of Old Montreal cogently explores \n the life and death of Marie-Joseph Angelique, a Portuguese-born Black slave woman \n who was hanged in Montreal in 1734 for allegedly setting fire to the city. Further, \n she is writing a series of historical novels for the young adult audience. These novels \n are based on the experiences on enslaved children from the Black Diaspora. For that \n series, Afua recently completed The Young Phillis Wheatley, a fictionalized account \n of the life and art of the eighteenth-century Black poet Phillis Wheatley. \n Dr. Cooper is currently the Ruth Wynn Woodward Endowed Chair in Women’s Studies at \n Simon Fraser University, British Columbia.",

To date, ecological systems under environmental noise are usually modeled as stochastic differential equations driven by a Brownian motion. Recognizing that the formulation using a Brownian motion is only an idealization, in this paper, it is assumed that the environment is subject to disturbances characterized by a jump process with rapid jump rates. Under broad conditions, it is shown that the systems under consideration can be approximated by a controlled diffusion system. Based on the limit diffusion system, control policies of the original systems are constructed. Such an approach enables us to develop sustainable harvesting policies leading to near optimality. To treat the underlying problems, one of the main difficulties is due to the long-run average objective function. This in turn, requires the handling of a number of issues related to ergodicity. New approaches are developed to obtain the tightness of the underlying processes based on the population dynamic systems.",

Further, microphthalmia stimulates the transcriptional activity of the tyrosinase promoter and cAMP increases the binding of microphthalmia to the CATGTG motif. These observations led us to hypothesize that microphthalmia mediates the effect of cAMP on the expression of tyrosinase. The present study was designed to elucidate the mechanism by which cAMP regulates microphthalmia function and to prove our former hypothesis, suggesting that microphthalmia is a key component in cAMP-induced melanogenesis. First, we showed that cAMP upregulates the transcription of microphthalmia gene through a classical cAMP response element that is functional only in melanocytes. Then, using a dominant-negative mutant of microphthalmia, we demonstrated that microphthalmia is required for the cAMP effect on tyrosinase promoter. These findings disclose the mechanism by which cAMP stimulates tyrosinase expression and melanogenesis and emphasize the critical role of microphthalmia as signal transducer in cAMP-induced melanogenesis and pigment cell differentiation.",

The nonlinear response characteristics are conducted by combining the stability analysis and the classification of the theoretical solutions. Especially, the dynamical hysteresis criterion which is used to determine the softening or hardening property is derived for enhancing energy harvesting performance. Meanwhile, the backbone curve is obtained. In addition, the influence of the excitation amplitude, the stiffness, the damping exponent, and the electromechanical coupling coefficient on the output power of the harvesters is explored. Overall, the physical mechanism of the harvesters is revealed and a framework for the optimization of maximizing the output power is provided.",

        "tahun_terbit":2004,
        "abstrak":"Myocardial infarctions, particularly the larger ones and anterior located, may result in important macroscopic changes, i.e. expansion of the infarct region and hypertrophy of distant areas, followed by a gradual dilatation and a change from the normal ellipsoid to a more spherical form over time. These conformational changes, commonly referred to as remodelling, are accompanied by a reduction in contractility and relaxation, a decrease in cardiac pump function and an increase in wall stress. If untreated, progressive cardiac dysfunction ensues and heart failure may develop. At the cellular level, necrosis, apoptosis and collagen degradation, leading to tissue loss can be found, together with different forms of collagen formation and fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy in non-infarcted tissue. Although cardiac hypertrophy may initially be compensatory, abnormalities in sarcolemnal receptor density, downstream signalling pathways, and in sarcoplasmatic reticulum and contractile protein function, hypertrophied cells eventually contribute inappropriately to cardiac function. There are quite a few mediators which become activated after an insult such as infarction and which trigger the remodelling processes described above. These include increased wall stress, ischemia, oxidative stress, cytokines, and in particular neurohormonal activation. The renin-angiotensin system is a well recognised neurohormonal activator of remodelling. Local tissue production of angiotensin II is observed after infarction, accompanied by increased ACE levels. ACE inhibition modulates cardiac remodelling, either or both by reducing angiotensin II formation and increased bradykinin production. Whether the latter is pivotal in this process is not entirely clear, although studies suggest that the anti-remodelling effect of the ACE inhibitor disappears when coadministered with a specific bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist [1]. Nevertheless, other studies would indicate similar effects against components of remodelling, e.g. fibrosis, by both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type I receptor antagonists [2]. Whatever the mechanism, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction ACE inhibition prevents cardiac dilatation over time, although it may not decrease cardiac size [3,4] As the sympathetic system and endothelins are likewise neurohormonal activators of remodelling, betablockade and endothelin antagonists are also considered to modulate cardiac remodelling. It is of interest that, at least in heart failure patients, additional betablockade with either carvedilol or metoprolol leads to a decrease in cardiac size as compared to only prevention of further dilatation as observed with ACE inhibition alone [4,5] Until recently, aldosterone was considered part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, produced in the adrenals by angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, however, is not the only stimulus, others like serum potassium, NO and ACTH stimulate aldosterone formation. Of importance, it is now realised that aldosterone and its receptor are present in target organs like the heart and the vascular wall, and may exert auto-or paracrine effects, rather than the endocrine function it was believed to have before. In the cardiovascular system aldosterone exerts a multitude of pathophysiologic actions. Sodium retention, volume expansion and diminished arterial compliance may underlie hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction, magnesium loss and increased PAI-1 levels may lead to or exacerbate ischemic events. Cardiac potassium loss, fibrosis and activation of the cardiac sympathetic system may lead to arrhythmias and sudden death. Fibrosis of the cardiovascular system is a typical feature of aldosterone and unrelated to the reninangiotensin system or to hypertensive effects of the hormone [6]. Aldosterone therefore may be viewed as a single, important player in cardiac remodelling under different conditions of pressureor volume overload. Blocking its effects with an aldosterone receptor antagonist prevents cardiac and vascular fibrosis without interfering acute scar formation. The latter would be of importance following an acute myocardial infarction.",

A convenient sample of 125 BA level students of English Language Teaching and Literature from three state universities in Iran took part in the study. As for the data collection procedure, these participants, in various time intervals, wrote an argumentative essay, responded to the composing process scale, completed the aptitude and working memory measures and filled in the questionnaires exploring their motivational propensities, self-efficacy beliefs and self-regulatory strategy use in writing. The collected data were analyzed by using Path Analysis and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). Due to some problems like small sample size and idiosyncratic nature of the data, the model did not give satisfactory fit indexes. However, it was found that cognitive variables were more strongly correlated with the writing competence of the learners than the motivational ones. More specifically, the construct of foreign language aptitude had the highest potential to account for the writing competence of the learners and the learners having different levels of this construct were different from each other in terms of writing quality and composing processes employed while writing.",

        "abstrak":"The banking industry in Kenya has been struggling in a hypercompetitive environment since the days of economic market liberalization. In current years the competition has been extremely intense with each bank fighting for its survival against competitors who do not only want to remain cost effective, drive profit but also attract and retain customers. This has driven the banks to embrace information technology to reduce the pressure to operate efficiently and profitably , as well as to provide those services that are provided in the rest of the world as today’s customer is no longer localized but globalized and his needs are no longer limited to his location. The Automated teller machine (ATM) has been one way in which the banks have embraced technology to provide better services to their customers. The deployment of ATMs has brought with itself challenges which were not apparent in the beginning, challenges like lack of skill, need for huge amounts of capital, lack of executive time to manage the ATM channel, security considerations and many others. These challenges have driven banks to look at outsourcing as one of the ways to mitigate these challenges. The objective of this study was to highlight the ATM service outsourcing models used in Kenya and the challenges that Kenyan banks have faced when outsourcing these services. All the banks in Kenya were surveyed. The study highlights the practices and the challenges. In this study senior bank managers that is ATM managers and IT managers were targeted to give a representative response to the survey. The survey revealed that several models are used in outsourcing of ATM services in Kenya, that there is no one prevalent model and that most of the banks own their own assets. The survey reveals that one of the major benefits the banks seek to achieve when outsourcing is to spur innovation followed closely by the need to improve customer service. It further indicated that challenges that are considered of importance are loss of control and some of the services being considered too critical to outsource. The report indicates that employee resistance to outsourcing is not considered a serious challenge when making the outsourcing decisions. Further research may be undertaken in Kenya on the subject of ATM services outsourcing to cover such areas as outsourcing failures, outsourcing risks, development of outsourcing partners and outsourcing partner selection.",

        "abstrak":"Nowadays, multiple different architectures exist, each one offering a performance boost on applications of different nature. Specialized and multicore computing is clearly mainstream, most application are ported or redesigned in order to expose any level of parallelism. Thus, new software and programming infrastructures have been introduced to help programmers exploit the benefits mutli-core and specialized computing have to offer. Radars are widely used for a variety of reasons. Their ability to operate in almost every weather condition, day and night, makes them an attractive solution. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a radar infrastructure capable of creating high resolution spatial images. Most SAR processing chains operate on the frequency domain for lower computational demands, but the multi-core era has made timedomain processing feasible. Time-domain SAR processing can be quite demanding in terms of computational power for large problem sizes but overcomes formulation problems that frequency-domain algorithms face. In this thesis, we investigated the possibility of achieving real-time performance on a SAR system, operating on the time-domain. For these purposes, the basic processing chain of such a system is analysed, implemented and optimized. Overall, we manage to achieve real-time performance for different output dimensions mainly targeting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and airborne solutions that operate under computational and power constraints. Furthermore, a hardware mapping of the computational components is proposed for their efficient execution. Moreover, we observe that multiple data rate reduction operations can be performed and still retain an acceptable Quality of System (QoS). Finally, the back-projection algorithm is optimized achieving a peak performance of 40 Giga Back-projections per second using a single hardware accelerator.",

The Dene, a subarctic indigenous people, have responded by turning to tradition and calling for more respectful hunting to demonstrate respectful reciprocity to the caribou, including a community-driven foodways project on caribou conservation and Dene caribou conservation which I co-facilitated in 2011. In these ways the caribou is approached as a person. Dene responses to caribou decline can best be understood by ontological theories of an expanded notion of indigenous personhood. However, I argue these theories are inadequate without an attention to foodways, specifically the getting, sharing, and returning of food to the land. The necessity of sustenance reveals a complicated relationship of give-and-take between humans and caribou, negotiated by tradition, yet complicated by the contemporary crisis.",

        "abstrak":"Reversible blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption has been uniformly reported in several animal models of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Nevertheless, the precise mechanism underlying this occurrence remains unclear. Using an aged rat model of POCD, we investigated the dynamic changes in expression of molecules involved in BBB disintegration, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9), as well as three of their endogenous tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP-1, -2, -3), and tried to establish the correlation between MMP\/TIMP balance and surgery-induced hippocampal BBB disruption. We validated the increased hippocampal expression of angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1) after surgery. We also found MMP\/TIMP imbalance as early as 6 h after surgery, together with increased BBB permeability and decreased expression of Occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), as well as increased basal lamina protein laminin at 24 h postsurgery. The AT1 antagonist candesartan restored MMP\/TIMP equilibrium and modulated expression of Occludin and laminin, but not ZO-1, thereby improving BBB permeability. These events were accompanied by suppression of the surgery-induced canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation cascade. Nevertheless, AT1 antagonism did not affect nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that surgery-induced Ang II release impairs BBB integrity by activating NF-κB signaling and disrupting downstream MMP\/TIMP balance via AT1 receptor.",

The result is something fairly rare in the writing of national histories. Denmark, from Sweden's point of view, was the traditional foe. In most histories of this kind such an animosity is reflected in trite chauvinistic statements of various sorts. The reader of this book, however, will find no such reflections.

        "tahun_terbit":2015,
        "abstrak":"[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Can you give a brief background of your exploration in the Arctic? It really started back in--well, I hate to illuminate how old I am, but--1986 when I had a chance to join an international expedition that was going to be dogsledding to the North Pole with the goal of being unsupported, to feel what it must have felt like to be those earlier explorers that came before us. So I joined the Steger International Polar Expedition. I was an elementary school teacher at the time, and an outdoor mountaineer, skier, camper, etc. The team consisted of seven guys, myself, and 49 male dogs. I took a leave of absence from my teaching in 1985. We trained in Northern Minnesota for some of the early months and then we moved onto Baffin Island for the final 2 months of our training. From there, we would continue north to the top of Canada, Ellesmere Island, where we would launch our two-month expedition to try to get to the top of the world across the sea ice. That was the beginning of everything. I thought at the time that that would be my only big public expedition, that I would go back to teaching, and that life would resume as it had been with both teaching and outdoor life, see-sawing back and forth. My world was turned upside down after that trip because people were making a big stink about the first known woman to the top of the world. There were a lot of new demands on my life that I wasn't necessarily equipped for or ready for. But I eventually adjusted and realized that I had this new platform, if you will, to speak from. I was asked to speak in front of a lot of groups and certainly felt most comfortable in front of kids. I thought that I really needed to pay attention to this opportunity and not squander it. And so as I started to think about my next expedition and started to figure out a way to make it less about my own personal ambition, which the North Pole trip had been. The only way I knew how to demonstrate something larger than me was through education. So, with the help of teachers from around the country, we wrote a curriculum so that we could engage kids around the United States with what we were doing and utilize the expedition to talk about bigger things, or more things. I led a team of women in 1992 across the Greenland ice caps east to west. From there we went south: we went off the coast of Chile and down to Antarctica--we skied from the edge to the South Pole. We were the first all women's group to do that. We had no dogs on this trip so we pulled 250-pound sleds each from sea level up to the Pole. With the help of all of these educators and students, we pulled our way and tried to write women into polar history a little further, a little deeper. I came home from that and still did not get it out of my system. I had scribbled in my journal at the South Pole in 1993 about an idea that I had had when I was a young girl (because of Ernest Shackleton and his great book, The Endurance). I had thought that I would love to cross the continent, and I now scribbled a sketch of a plan having seen the Antarctic ice and the differences between the Antarctic and the Arctic. Of course, these things take years to percolate and plan for and raise money for. So in the process of this, my plan was to bring just one other person with me. You can go pretty fast and furious if you do not have a group that is going up and down in terms of the psychology of personalities and decision-making--you can be a little more nimble with just a couple of people. In the course of doing the first Antarctic trip, I started corresponding with a Norwegian woman who, the following year, went all by herself to the South Pole on virtually the same route that we had taken. We shared information before her trip about what I had seen and learned--wind direction and those kinds of things. And so, from afar, I watched her complete a beautiful expedition by herself and I thought, well that is the person that I want. …",

Cryo-techniques can observe in theiroriginal morphology and structure without various artifacts fromconventional sample preparation.

In the years following his death in 1963, his reputation and stature have continued to grow, thanks to the work of an expanding group of interested poets and teachers, critics and scholars. Now he is pretty securely settled among the half-dozen or so most important poets in American literary history.

The purpose of this paper is to explore in detail how religion and family religious rituals relate to, interface with, and affect the day-to-day activity of family life. It includes qualitative analysis of interviews with highly religious parents and children in 67 families that belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Grounded theory was employed to analyze the data and a conceptual model was developed to illustrate how this particular sample experienced religious integration. Findings suggest that for this sample, religion was more than an external influence; it was viewed as an integral part of one’s individual, familial, structural, and social systems. This finding challenges traditional human ecological theory which suggests that religion is merely an external influence. Findings also indicate that religious rituals were viewed as being an important part of everyday life for the majority of this sample. Despite challenges of religious rituals, participants indicated that they experienced positive individual and familial outcomes when participating in family religious rituals. No negative outcomes were reported. Comparative analysis between participants in the higher and lower overall family functioning groups suggests that religious ritual properties and perceptions differed for these two groups. Those in the higher family functioning group mentioned more frequently that religious rituals were an enjoyable part of family life while those in the lower family functioning group mentioned more frequently they were motivated by a sense of duty to participate in these rituals. Other differences between these two groups are discussed. Though this sample allowed for a thick description of one particular culture to be produced, findings from this study cannot be generalized beyond highly religious LDS families. Despite limitations, the overwhelming perception that religious integration and religious rituals enhanced individual and family life has potentially far reaching implications. These findings should be strongly considered and applied to future research, clinical practice, and family life education.",

Total of 28 species of butterflies werefound with maximum individuals of common grass yellow with relative abundance of 17.53 and least 0.74 was recorded for Common silver-line. Eleven species of snakes were recorded in the studied area, including both venomous and non-venomous species. The study was an attempt to evaluate abundance, occurrence and species richness of both species. This study can play crucial role in conservation of biodiversity of studied area.",

        "abstrak":"Abstract We have investigated the reactions of C−2 and HC−2 with N2, N2O, NO, NO2 and O2 by using a selected-ion flow drift tube at 300 K. Rate coefficients and branching fractions were measured as a function of ion\/neutral average center-of-mass kinetic energy (〈KEcm〉) over the range from about 0.04 to 0.25 eV. The reaction of C−2 with NO forms CN− (about 11%), NCO− (about 6%), and reactive electron detachment products (about 83%). The rate coefficient at 300K is 1.2 (±0.3) × 10−10 cm3 s−1 and decreases with energy as 〈KEcm〉−0.7, while the product branching fractions are energy independent. The reaction of C−2 with NO2 forms C2O− (about 74%), CNO− (or NCO−) (about 14%) and CN− (about 12%). The rate coefficient for this reaction is 4.8 (±1.2) × 10−10 cm3 s−1 at 300K, and both the rate coefficient and branching fractions are approximately independent of kinetic energy over the range investigated. The reaction of C−2 with O2 forms C2O− (about 70%) and reactive electron detachment products (about 30%). The rate coefficient for this reaction is 1.5 (±0.4) × 10−11 cm3 s−1 at 300K and increases as 〈KEcm〉+0.7 over the energy range studied. C−2 is unreactive towards N2 and N2O within our experimental sensitivity over the energy range studied. HC−2 reacts with NO2 to form HC2O− with a rate coefficient of 1.8 × 10−10 cm3 s−1 at 300 K; the rate coefficient decreases with energy as 〈KEcm〉−0.7. HC−2 does not react with N2, N2O, NO or O2 within our experimental sensitivity over the energy range studied. The measured parameters are discussed in terms of the characteristic reactivity of the anions and possible reaction mechanisms. Finally, CN− was found to be unreactive towards NO and O2 within experimental uncertainty at 300 K and no applied electric field, and reacts inefficiently with NO2 with a rate coefficient less than or equal to 6 × 10−12 cm3 s−1.",

Intelligent failure detection is necessary for the effective functioning of the sensor network. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning method that is named artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN), to predict temperature in a remote location and detect failures in sensors. It allows predicting the temperature and detecting failure in sensor node of remote locations using information from a web service comparing it with field temperature sensors. For experimentation, we implemented a small WSN to test our sensor in order to measure failure detection, identification and accommodation proposal. In our experiments, 94.18% of the testing data were recovered and accommodated allowing of validation our proposed approach that is based on AHN, which detects, identify and accommodate sensor failures accurately.",

        "tahun_terbit":2010,
        "abstrak":"Early-age cracking can adversely affect the behavior and durability of bridge deck concrete. Cracking of hardening concrete occurs when the induced tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the concrete. The development of in-place stresses is affected by the shrinkage, modulus of elasticity, coefficient of thermal expansion, setting characteristics, restraint conditions, stress relaxation, and temperature history of the hardening concrete. Tensile strength increases as the hydration of the cementitious system progresses. Rigid cracking frame (RCF) testing techniques capture the combined effects of modulus of elasticity, creep and relaxation, coefficient of thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, autogenous shrinkage, and tensile strength on the cracking potential of a mixture in a specific application. This paper describes an experimental evaluation of the effect of supplementary cementing materials, water-to-cement ratio (w\/c), and placement temperature conditions on the early-age cracking tendency of bridge deck concrete through the use of RCF testing techniques. Specimens were tested under temperature conditions that match those in an 8-in.-thick bridge deck to explore early-age cracking mechanisms. The laboratory testing program revealed that the placement temperature and curing temperature significantly affected the time to cracking of all the mixtures. Use of either fly ash or ground-granulated blast-furnace slag was effective in reducing the heat generation and rate of stiffness development in bridge deck concretes and thus in significantly reducing restraint stresses and delayed the occurrence of cracking at early ages. A decrease in w\/c resulted in increased stresses, and it accelerated the occurrence of cracking at early ages.",

        "abstrak":"In some cases of degenerative knee condition, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be a successful surgical treatment to restore the knee’s functionality, if carried out correctly. Since each patient has different bone shapes and soft tissues mechanical properties, the 3D complex roto-translation movement and the kinetics of the knee change as well. For these reasons, nowadays, several methodologies are carried out to analyse and predict the three-dimensional behaviour of a native or post-arthroplasty knee. To overcome the limitations of the in vivo analysis, such as low amount of analysed specimens for specific boundary conditions, and of the cadaver tests, in terms of high costs, lack of repeatability and ethical issues, the use of numerical modelling is becoming a fundamental tool to better understand the patient-specific knee joint anatomy and functionality.The purpose of this research project was to produce a protocol in order to develop and validate a patient specific finite element model comparing numerical outcomes, in terms of kinematics and kinetics, with in vitro results obtained during cadaver test performed on the same specimen under the same boundary conditions.Guide lines about experimental test were given, showing step by step the surgical specimen preparation and all the procedures to calibrate and utilise maps pressure sensors and motion capture systems. CT images, mechanical properties estimated through tensile test of ligaments, and boundary conditions applied during the experimental test, were used to develop the patient-specific Finite Element model. Therefore, the same active motor task simulated with the cadaver specimen was reproduced with a numerical approach.A final comparison analysis between numerical and experimental outcomes showed that, the tibiofemoral kinematics were validated both in terms of translations and rotations. Instead, regarding to kinetics, while the patellofemoral contact areas and contact pressures predicted using FE model were validated for the main significant flexion angles, it could be validated only the tibiofemoral contact areas because the relative contact pressures measured during the cadaver test resulted uncorrected and in disagreement with the literature.",

        "abstrak":"ATX-s10 is a novel and second-generation photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). In order to conduct clinical trials of ATX-s10-PDT and\/or extend its clinical applications, it is very important to elucidate the mechanisms of the action of ATX-s10-PDT. We examined the apoptic response against ATX-s10-PDT using a Bcl-2 or Bcl-2 mutant overexpressing cells. Using fluorescent microscopy, ATX-s10 localized not only to mitochondria but also to lysosomes and possibly other intracellular organelles, but not to the plasma membrane or the nucleus. These results suggest that ATX-s10-PDT can damage mitochondria and lysosomes. By Western blot analysis, ATX-s10-PDT damaged Bcl-2, which localized preferentially at mitochondrial membranes, and caused Bcl-2 to cross-link immediately after laser irradiation. However, ATX-s10-PDT was not able to rapidly induce morphologically typical apoptosis (i.e. chromatin condensation and fragmentation) as PDT using mitochondria targeted photosensitizers, such as phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4). Pharmacological inhibitions of lysosomal cytokine protease cathepsins, such as cathepsin B and D, protected MCF-7c3 cells (human breast cancer cells expressing stably transfected procaspase-3) from apoptosis caused by ATX-s10-PDT. Overexpression of wild-type Bcl-2 or Bcl-2Delta33-54 resulted in relative resistance of cells to ATX-s10-PDT, as assessed by the degree of morphological apoptosis or loss of clonogenicity. We conclude that lysosomal damage by ATX-s10-PDT can initiate apoptotic response and this apoptotic pathway can be regulated by photodamage to Bcl-2 via mitochondrial damage.",

We use TDTR to show that displacement damage from ion irradiation can significantly reduce the thermal conductivity of Optimized ZIRLO, a material used as fuel cladding in several current nuclear reactors. We find that the thermal conductivity of copper-niobium nanostructured multilayers does not change with helium ion irradiation doses of up to 1015 cm-2 and ion energy of 200 keV suggesting that these structures can be used and radiation tolerant materials in nuclear reactors. We compare the effect of ion doses and ion beam energies on the measured thermal conductivity of bulk silicon.

        "abstrak":"Lifibrol is a powerful cholesterol‐lowering drug of unknown mechanism of action. This investigation was carried out to determine whether the major action of lifibrol is to enhance clearance of low density lipoproteins (LDL) through the LDL‐receptor pathway, and if so, whether the drug exerts its action by altering the excretion of bile acids (acidic steroids), the absorption of cholesterol, or the synthesis of cholesterol. In a first study, in two patients with complete absence of LDL receptors, lifibrol therapy had essentially no effect on plasma LDL concentrations; in two others who had a marked reduction in LDL‐receptor activity, response to the drug was attenuated. These findings suggest that lifibrol requires an intact LDL‐receptor pathway to exert its action. In a second study, in patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolemia, isotope kinetic studies showed that lifibrol enhanced the fractional catabolic rate of LDL‐apolipoprotein B (apo B), but had no effect on transport rates of LDL; these observations likewise support the probability that lifibrol acts mainly to increase the activity of the LDL‐receptor pathway. However, in a third study in hypercholesterolemic patients, lifibrol therapy failed to increase acidic steroid excretion, inhibit cholesterol absorption, or reduce net cholesterol balance. Furthermore, lifibrol treatment did not significantly reduce urinary excretion of mevalonic acid. In contrast, in a parallel study, simvastatin therapy, which is known to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, gave the expected decrease in net cholesterol balance and reduction in urinary excretion of mevalonic acid. Thus, lifibrol, like statins, appears to increase the activity of LDL receptors; but in contrast to findings with statins, it was not possible to detect a significant decreased synthesis of cholesterol, either from balance studies or from urinary excretion of mevalonic acid. This finding raises the possibility that lifibrol activates the LDL‐receptor pathway through a different mechanisms which remains to be determined.",

The eight STP contributed about 44 530 kg suspended sediments, 3380 kg total P, 1340 kg NH4-N, and 116 900 kg NO3-N to the watershed annually. Drainage systems added less NH4-N and P, but more NO3-N and suspended solids to surface waters than STP. Tile drainage pathways for NO3-N, STP in the case of P, and overland pathways for sediment are indicated as targets to control loading in artificially drained agricultural watersheds.",

The study is based on applying statistical, spectral and fractal metrics on recorder differential pressure measurements of air-water system. It is found that a highly sampled pressure signals can provide useful information using spectral and statistical tools, whereas a slowly sampled signal can only deliver meaningful details when spectral analysis is employed. Moreover, the addition of 5% polyethylene, which acts as coalescence inhibitor, to the air-water system showed a similar statistical and spectral behavior to that of sole air-water system. However, the averaged-frequency of the power spectra and the Hurst exponent managed to unfold the characteristics of flow regimes in both media and to disclose the discrepancy between coalescing (air-water) and the non-coalescing (5% polyethylene in air-water) solutions.",

Long latency flexor reflex (LLFR) which has helped to advance RLS pathophysiology has never been investigated in akathisia. Due to the clinical commonalities of akathisia and RLS, we investigated the behavior of LLFR in patients with akathisia aiming to understand pathophysiology of akathisia.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nSeven patients with neuroleptic-induced akathisia, 12 drug-naïve patients with primary RLS and 17 healthy subjects were prospectively enrolled in the study. LLFR was recorded from unilateral tibialis anterior (TA) and long head of biceps femoris (BF) muscles after stimulating the sole by trains of electrical stimuli. We measured amplitude, latency, duration, presence of response and compared between three groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne-way ANOVA showed mean durations of early and late responses recorded over TA were the longest in akathisia group compared to both RLS group and healthy subjects (p=0.012). The spatial spread of LLFR in akathisia patients was comparable to those of healthy subjects whereas presence of response on BF was significantly less in akathisia than RLS group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings indicate increased excitability of LLFR pathway in akathisia group. These findings are probably due to lack of inhibition originated in regions other than those known to downregulate in RLS.",

In this analysis, we first employed linkage analysis based on frailty models that take into account age of onset information to establish which regions along the chromosome are likely to harbor disease susceptibility genes for alcohol dependence. Second, we used an association analysis by exploiting linkage disequilibrium to narrow down the peak regions.

        "abstrak":"Small high-activity radioactive particles of nominal diameter ranging from approximately 1 mm down to several microm have been a radiological concern over the last 30 years in and around European and American nuclear reactor facilities. These particles have often been referred to as 'hot particles'. The 'hot particle problem' came into prominent concern in the late 1960s. The potential carcinogenic effects in lungs as the result of irradiation by discrete small particles containing alpha-emitting radionuclides, particularly (239)Pu, were claimed by some to be several orders of magnitude greater than those produced by uniform irradiation to the same mean dose. The phrase 'hot particle problem' was subsequently used to refer to the difficulty of predicting health effects for all microscopic radioactive sources. The difficulty arose because of the paucity of comparative human, animal or cell studies using radioactive particles, and the lack of validated measurement or calculational techniques for dose estimation for non-uniform exposures. Experience was largely restricted to uniform, large-area\/volume exposures. The concern regarding cancer induction was extended to deterministic effects when the ICRP in 1977 failed to give adequate dose limits for dealing with 'hot particle' exposures of the skin. Since 1980, considerable efforts have been made to clarify and solve the dosimetric and radiobiological issues related to the health effects of 'hot particle' exposures. The general recommendations of the ICRP in 1991 used the latest radiobiological data to provide skin dose limits which are applicable to 'hot particle' exposures. More recently the NCRP has extended considerations to other organs. This progress is reviewed and applied to the specific case of the recent evaluation of potential health effects of Dounreay fuel fragments commissioned by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). Analyses of possible doses and risks in this case indicate that the principal concern following skin contact, ingestion or inhalation is the possibility of localised ulceration of skin or of the mucosal lining of the colon or extra-thoracic airways.",

Although financial models are useful as a general screening and evaluation device, the authors caution that they do not fully capture other factors important to viability, such as managerial and technical capability or a community's ability to support water system costs. Because financial performance is so vital to the viability of water systems, methods specifically designed to assess the financial health of existing and emerging systems are needed. Identifying failing water utilities as early as possible is important because their distress can seriously affect investors, creditors, ratepayers, local government agencies, and regulatory commissions. Besides risking their financial health, weak and failing companies pose a potential risk to human health and should be identified.

According to a recent report of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, 10 carcinogenic PAHs together with 53 other known carcinogens are present in cigarette smoke. Accurate quantification of these chemicals helps assess public health risk to both smokers and nonsmokers exposed to second-hand smoke. We have developed and validated a specific and sensitive method for measuring these 10 carcinogenic PAHs in the particulate phase of mainstream tobacco smoke. Cigarette smoke particulate, produced using standard machine smoking protocols, was collected on glass fiber Cambridge filter pads. The particulate matter was solvent extracted, purified by solid-phase extraction, and analyzed by liquid chromatography\/atmospheric pressure photoionization tandem mass spectrometry using isotopically labeled analogues as internal standards. Our method's limits of detection ranged from 11 to 166 pg and achieved sufficient reproducibility and accuracy to provide useful information on a range of cigarettes having dramatically different machine-smoked tar and nicotine deliveries. The identity of each PAH analyte was established from chromatographic retention time, analyte-specific fragmentation patterns, and relative peak area ratios of the product\/precursor ion pairs. This new method provides higher sensitivity, specificity, and throughput than did earlier methods. We found relatively consistent PAH levels among a selection of domestic full-flavor cigarettes. The PAH levels in smoke from highly ventilated light and ultralight cigarettes were low when smoked using ISO (International Organization for Standardization) conditions. However, if highly ventilated cigarettes were smoked under more intense conditions (e.g., larger or more frequent puffs, vents blocked), their PAH levels equaled or exceeded their full-flavor counterparts under ISO conditions.",

Twenty-five patients presented with ulcers (stomach or duodenum), 2 with severe gastritis, 6 with small bowel obstruction or perforation and 3 patients had both an ulcer and bowel obstruction. A previous laparotomy played an important role. While the complication rate was 2.7% without any previous abdominal surgery, it was 11.5% after laparotomy (p less than 0.001). Fractionation was also found to be of importance in the occurrence of complications: three different weekly schedules were used -5 x 2 Gy, 4 x 2.5 Gy and 3 x 3.3 Gy; the GIT complication rates were 4, 9 and 22%, respectively (p less than 0.001). When combining laparotomy and fractionation, we found that the patients who were treated using 5 weekly fractions of 2 Gy without any prior laparotomy had a very low rate of late digestive complications (1%), whereas the patients who received 3 weekly fractions of 3.3 Gy after laparotomy presented a 39% complication rate. The other subgroups of patients were at an intermediate risk (from 5 to 13%) of late digestive injuries.

TE also specifically increased the expression of the non-selective transient receptor potential canonical (subtype) 6 (TRPC6) in keratinocytes, and knocking down TRPC6 inhibited keratin 10 upregulation. Ex vivo, in human skin explants TE induced the expression of TRPC6 in the epidermis and increased DNA fragmentation of terminally differentiating keratinocytes. Topical treatment with TE of actinic keratoses, that represent in situ squamous cell carcinomas with disturbed epithelial differentiation, resulted in downgrading of aberrant Ki67 expression and upregulation of keratin 10 in vivo.

        "tahun_terbit":2000,
        "abstrak":"The dioecious, neotropical plant species Clusia grandiflora produces two major pools of secondary metabolites, latex and floral resin. Latex serves as a defense against herbivory and floral resin as a pollinator reward. This reward is gathered by bees who use it as a nest construction material. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectral studies show that C. grandiflora latex and resin share two classes of compounds, poly-isoprenylated benzophenones and tocotrienoic acids as major or minor components. The close chemical correspondence between latex and resin indicate that they are evolutionarily related. Though the tocotrienes were not found to have biological activity, benzophenones with potent bactericidal activity were isolated from both latex and resin. Bioassays show that these compounds are especially toxic to the honeybee pathogens Paenibacillus larvae and P. alvei. In pollinator reward resin, bioactive benzophenones are major components, whereas in latex they are minor components. Since latex is ancestral to resin in Clusia, it appears that the pollinator reward system may have arisen from the defensive system through modification of latex-producing tissues in the flower. Subsequent selective pressure from bee pollinators, who benefited from bactericidal activity in the reward, caused resin chemistry to diverge from its latex-like ancestral form. This selection has resulted in the high levels of activity observed in modem resin. In populations of C. grandiflora growing in southeastern Venezuela, male and female resins exhibit a pronounced dimorphism in chemical makeup. Female resin possesses a single benzophenone and male resin numerous benzophenones. Female resin is more bioactive",

The SEM image revealed a nanopod-like structure for the deposited CuI films while the XRD results confirmed the crystalline nature of the films with a face centered cubic structure. The optical results showed a progressive decrease of the absorbance values at increasing wavelengths while the optical bandgap energy of the undoped CuI film reduced from 2.47eV to 1.90eV, 1.75eV and 1.8eV for the Al-doped, Pb-doped and Zn-doped CuI films respectively. The undopedCuI film also showed a higher extinction coefficient value than the metallic-doped CuI films. The Zn-doped film had the maximum specific capacitance of 116 F g−1at 2 mV\/s.",

The performances and interplant variabilities of both generations were little affected by any of the alien cytoplasms, but sterility increased slightly by the vavilcvii cytoplasm in the F2 generation. Transgressive segregation attributable to the nucleus × cytoplasm interaction could not be detected in the present F2, in contrast with some positive transgressive segregation observed in the F2 of the cross between two related cultivars, Norin 61 and Norin 26, under the presence of the speltoides and kotschyi cytoplasms (TSUNEWAKI et al. 1985). Neither the heterosis nor the heritability in a broad sense was affected significantly by any alien cytoplasm.

        "tahun_terbit":2009,
        "abstrak":"In July, 2007, a 28-year-old man came to our institute. Until recently, he had worked as a fi sherman, off the coast of Kerala—where boats traditionally carry 4–5 fi sher men, who must row against strong currents and waves. He had had to leave his job, because, when rowing, he could not keep to the same rhythm as his fellows: he could not extend his elbows rapidly after fl exion. After 5 min, this problem disappeared. Additionally, he could not release his grip quickly, after holding things tightly. His problems had gradually increased over 5 years; he had had to leave his job, and was now working as an assistant in a roadside shop. He had no other medical history of note. General examination showed nothing of note. Neurological examination showed no abnormality of cognitive function, cranial nerves, the somatosensory system, or cerebellum; power and refl exes were normal, and the patient had no muscle atrophy or fasciculations. However, repeated gripping and releasing of the examiner’s fi ngers, tapping over the extensor digitorum communis, and tapping the tongue revealed grip myotonia, percussion myotonia, and tongue myotonia respectively. Blood tests revealed a high concentration of creatine kinase (CK) (2960 IU\/L; normal range 21–232 IU\/L). Needle electromyography (EMG) showed diff use myotonic discharges (fi gure), but no evidence of myopathy. On cooling of muscle to 20°C, by wrapping the limb in a plastic bag and immersing it in iced water, and after short and long periods of exercise (voluntary contraction of the muscle tested, for 5–10 s and 3–5 min with brief rest breaks), we found no decrease in compound muscle action-potential amplitude. These fi ndings were consistent with true myotonia. But of what cause? The age of onset, high concentration of CK, and normal EMG after exercise were atypical for myotonia congenita. The persistence of symptoms indicated that the patient probably did not have potassium-aggravated myotonia (also known as myotonia fl uctuans). Slit-lamp examin ation showed no cataract, which, together with the absence of muscle weakness, made type 1 myotonic dystrophy unlikely; moreover, genetic testing for this disease gave a negative result. However, routine echo cardiography revealed mode rate pericardial eff usion without tamponade, so we requested thyroid function tests. The thyrotropin con cen tration was very high (>60 mIU\/L; normal range 0∙25–5 mIU\/L); tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations were low, at <0∙4 nmol\/L (normal 0∙92–2∙33 nmol\/L) and 8∙01 nmol\/L (normal 60–120 nmol\/L) respect ively. We prescribed thyroxine. The pa tient’s symp toms subsided rapidly. At 3-month and 6-month follow-up, we found no clinical or electro physiological evidence of myotonia; concentrations of CK and thyroid hormones were normal. When last seen, in June, 2008, the patient was well, on a thyroxine dose of 200 μg daily, and had returned to work as a fi sher man. Myotonia is the slow relaxation of muscle, after voluntary contraction or percussion. It is painless, but patients often describe muscle stiff ness that improves with repeated use of muscle, the so-called “warm-up phenomenon”. On examination, myotonia may be evident from a delayed release of the hand, in the introductory handshake. EMG shows spontaneous, repetitive discharges with waxing and waning of amplitude and frequency, producing a characteristic “dive-bomber” like sound. Myotonia can be a presenting sign of myotonic dystrophy; non-dystrophic myotonias, in which mytonia is caused by dysfunction of channels for chloride (in myotonia congenita) or sodium (in paramyotonia congenita, potassium-aggravated myotonia, and hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis with myotonia); myopathies (acid maltase defi ciency, polymyositis, myotubular myopathy); or, rarely, denervation of any cause. Syndromes causing myotonia are distinguished by associated clinical features, and by EMG after cooling and exercise. Pseudomyotonia is slow relaxation without myotonic discharge on EMG, and is found in hypothyroidism, when it is characteristically revealed by testing of tendon refl exes. However, hypothyroidism can also cause true myotonia, and can unmask type 2 myotonic dystrophy. Patients with myotonia caused by hypo thyroidism should be given thyroxine; patients in whom myotonic dystrophy is unmasked may benefi t symptom atically from thyroxine, despite persistent myotonic dis charges on EMG. We suspect, on clinical grounds, that our patient had myotonia caused by hypothyroidism; he declined genetic testing for type 2 myotonic dystrophy.",

        "abstrak":"Clinical candidates should have pharmacokinetics (PK) consistent with an advantageous drug product profile and have minimal toxicity. In the past, poor properties resulted in inadequate PK and toxicity and caused attrition during development. Thus, responsibility for optimization of PK and safety was integrated into drug discovery. The strategy used for optimization is an iterative cycle of property assessment and structure modification, the same as for activity optimization. This approach is possible because a compound’s chemical structure determines its physicochemical and biochemical properties, which determine its in vivo PK and safety. In silico, in vitro, and in vivo tools are used for efficient PK and safety assessment. Another benefit of assessing properties is that previously unknown property limitations (e.g., insolubility, chemical degradation) caused inaccurate bioassay data and structure-activity relationships, but this can now be averted. Optimal clinical candidates have a balance of activity, selectivity, PK, and safety. Drug development resources are more likely to be invested when due diligence shows a strong and balanced clinical candidate. Drug development is more efficient and patient compliance is higher. An additional benefit is that property data can be used to predict human PK and toxicity for reliable clinical candidate selection and clinical planning. Discussion of the iterative PK\/safety optimization process (assessment ↔ structure modification), drug discovery bioassay improvement, and human clinical prediction are the themes of this book.",

The four agonists were equi-efficacious in evoking [3H]noradrenaline release from hippocampal synaptosomes. Nicotine-evoked synaptosomal release was tetrodotoxin-insensitive. Somatodendritic nicotinic cholinoceptors on dopaminergic neurons were studied using a dendrosomal [3H]dopamine release assay and also in locomotor activity tests. In both assays, nicotine appeared more efficacious than epibatidine. Furthermore, with repeated nicotine exposure, the acute locomotor stimulant response to nicotine increased, whereas the epibatidine response became undetectable.
